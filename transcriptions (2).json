common framework for applying a video services and finally section three describes the steps you should take it you wanna continue working towards a nebula certified machine learning specialty in this section you'll learn about some of the more common job roles for machine learning professionals if you're interested in a day is going to stroll focus on developing analytical statistical and programming skills as it is scientists your use those skills to collect analyze and interpret large this is some universities now offer degrees and a assignments again as scientists often have degrees related fields like statistics that computer science or economics as a scientist you're a technical competencies in statistics machine learning programming languages in de analytics if you like to have a careerism issue you're an engineer the skills you only you'll be similar to revere scientists skill set when they are scientists were shimmering in years boss or our technical competence season statistics and machine learning however your focus more on programming skills and softer architecture that analysis interpretation as an issue mining engineer you apply those programming in architecture skills to design an old machine learning systems were shimmering engineers often have previous experience was offered a bellman and they rely more heavily on programming and software engineering and father were shame learning rolls you might also be interested in a career in science we can apply machine learning technology cheer field the shimmering is having any impact in everything from astronomy to zoology so there are many different paths open to as applied science research or your primary focus will be on the type of sideshow working on killing some of the same skills as it is time to we'll also need to know how to apply those skills you chosen domain thus applied science rolls alter our technical competence in statistics spanish in learning many soft developers are now hearing great english you learning to their applications if you're interested in a courier software developer you should also include regime loring technology new stars as a machine learning developer your primary focus will be so offered on skills will also need some of the same skills as a scientist to make sure you take course working statistics and applied mathematics and

were when you talk about what machine learning it's this course is an introduction to machine learning which is also known as m. l. o. first will discuss where she learning fits in a larger picture wish you learning is a subset of artificial intelligence or am i this is a broad branch of computer science this focus on building machines they can do human tasks people earning is a song domain of machine learning to understand where it is all fit together we'll discuss each one as we just mentioned me she learning is a subset of a broader computer science field known as artificial intelligence ai focuses on building machines they can perform tasks are human would take a quick perform in contemporary popular culture you've probably seen a allies in movies television or works of fiction for

sheen could work twenty four salmon and not need any breaks the oriental we're not going until the next robot ai in this course maybe an extra if you do a search you can only find many definitions of machine learning there isn't a universally agreed upon definition sol star by looking at kabul definitions for example we could say machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms in statistical models to perform a task by using the inference instead of instructions this is a bad starting point a key point year is using algorithms as statistical models instead of instructions to help you better understand this will apply this idea to a concrete example suppose you need to write an application that determines if an email message to stammer not without ratio morning you need to write a complex series of decisions the shoes in gift and l. statements you also need to use words in the subject or body the number only example length of a message to determine if an email message is salem really hard am labor intensive to build all our summer rolls covering every possibility that machine learning however you can use a list of e-mail messages or marcus am or not stay i'm a train a machine learning all the model with them alarm which patterns of words way it and other attributes are good indicators of spam messages if you present along with an email message it hadn't seen before the model would perform a production to say whether the message was stale or not stale people earning represents a significant reborn the capabilities for artificial intelligence of the shimmering that the reminded warning was created from hell the human brain works an artificial neural network or cannon is inspired by the biological neurons found in the brain all of the implications become very different artificial neurons have one or more imports and a single out what these neurons fire or activate their house was based on the transformation of the influx a neural network is composed of layers of these artificial neurons with connections between the letters they're typically input output he and his lawyers in our the output of a single neural and connection the influx of all when you're on stay in the next layer the network is an ass to solve a problem the input layers populated from the training dana and then you're on saturday to outer layers until it answers presented in the alpo later the accuracy of the output is then measured in the alpine doesn't mean you're threshold the training is repeated was slight changes to the weights of the connections between your arms the neural network will do this repeatedly each time it strengthens the connections that lead to success and diminishes the connections that lead to failure as you'll see him as corps machine learning practitioners and a whole lot of time optimize and anno models selecting the best it features to train with hands like animals with the best results in contrast the boring practitioners and almost no time on those tasks instead they spend their time on irwindale with different annan architectures bullet theory for people earning goes back decades the hardware needed to wendy boring promise was in jail inaccessible until recently when alex available you can use deep learning to address palms over more complex than the problems you could have worked on for mainstream machine learning is a recent occurrence rapid advances in machine in deep mourning only started are on a two thousand as this is partly because moore's law and the rise of cotton to the result in any easier access to larger faster and cheaper computing storage capabilities you can now read computing power for a few hours for pennies before this union substantial investments to bind operate large

the accuracy rate jumped up to about eighty two percent is been steadily climbing ever says in fact exceeded human performance in two thousand fifteen years some of it he'd take away is for this section first artificial intelligence is in broad field of building machines to perform human tests also machine learning is a psalm senate ai it focuses on using dared to train regime learning models so they can make projections deep learning is a technique inspired from human biology he uses layers of artificial neurons to know now works as all problems unless advancements in technology cloud

"CUR-TF-200-ACMNLP-1/video/Mod02_Sect02.mp4": "i am more combat in this section we're going to look at that height some business problems machine learning killed use all mushy learning is used all across your visualize your e-mails sailor filter is the result of a machine learning program that was trained with examples of stale and regular you know masters based on what you reading our product you want me she'll learning programs can predict all their books or prodigy likely be interested in again the machine learning program was trying with data from other readers have its emperors when detecting credit card fraud the she'll infrared were strain on examples of transactions that turn out to the fraud along with normal transactions you probably think and many more examples from social media applications eugene facial attention to grumpier photos detecting brain tumors in brain scans or finding anomalies in extremes there are three main types of machine learning their supervise learning or a modeling is is known in puts an all points to generalize future out what's theirs on unsupervised learning with a model doesn't know him put her out what's so it finds patterns in the day without help and there's reinforce the learning with a model interacts with its environment and learned to take actions that wall maximize rewards it's important to know the different types of m. l. because that height will guide you course selecting algorithms that makes sense for solving your business draw what's one more in each of these types supervise learning is a popular type of an owl because it's widely applicable it's called supervise learning because there needs to be a supervisor a teacher or cooking show the right answers as the white any state in the supervised algorithm needs to learn by example essentially it needs a teacher who uses training dana to help and determine the patterns relationships between u. puts out what's if you want to build an application to detect credit card fraud you'd need training to that includes examples of fraud and examples of normal transactions with a unsupervised learning there are different types of problems classification and regression third to some types of classification problems the first is a binary classification think back to the example with identifying fraudulent transactions that are never able and is example is limited to two options fraudulent or not fraudulent this is a binary class vacation problem they're also like class classification problems these dental problems classify observation into one of three or more categories same g. m. and m. l. model the predicts why customers calling your store chain to reduce the number of transfers needed before costly gets to the crack customer support a partner in this case is different koster support apartments were present over ryan you potential party variables which giving many different apartments much more than just to there also were aggression problems in our russian problem you're no longer masking indian put two and a fine number of categories instead you're mapping in england tweaking teen u. s. value what the nurtured one example of an m. l. regression problem is predicting the price of a company stock computer vision is a good example of civilized learning is is i can or a dog is there a tumor in this x-ray computer vision is often bill with people earning models it on it's the extraction analysis classification and understanding of useful information from a single image or sequence images computer vision it enables machines twenty five people places and things in images with accuracy at or about human levels and with greater speed and efficiency the image ticking taken many forms such is the single images video sequences views from multiple cameras or three dimensional day and you'll learn more about computer vision lira's course will not discuss was supervised the she'll learn sometimes all you have is the day and there's no supervisor in the room in all unsupervised learning labels are provided like they are was supervised learning you know in all the variables and patterns in these instances the machine has to uncovering create the labels itself these models used to date other presented with to detect emerging properties of the entire day recess then they can shrug hundred from those properties clustering is a common some category of one survives learning this time algorithm groups the into different clusters basis similar features it does is to better understand the attributes of a specific cluster for example by delisting customer purchasing habits was revised algorithms can identify groups of customers that are associated with the size tier of accompany the advantage of one supervised on rooms is that enable you to see patterns and in the war aware of before natural language processing is also known as an l. p. this is another area of machine learning is experiencing role if you've ever use all access or any and all the voices system they'll use an old peter trying is your question and l. p. isn't just about speech is also about written tax an elk he shows up in many applications for example an hour he's used with chat or call center box which are automated systems that helped you get your bank accounts will order food for russia you can use an opium translation tools which covered tax between languages for example you might use applications the translating menus real time i know he is also used in voice to tax translations which covered spoken words into tax and finally an l. p. good news then sends an analysis which you can use to analyze the sentiment of commons and reviews of products music and movies the senate's could be used to give the movie audience reading you were more about penalty later in the scores another kind of machine learning this thing gaining popularity recently is reinforced the learning on like a father ratio learning reinforce the learning continuously improve is a small by mining feedback from previous generations in reinforce the learning an aging continuously learns to trial and error as interaction in barman we enforce learning is broadly useful when the reward of undesirable and is known that the path to achieving it isn't an act have requires a lot on trial and error to discover take the example of a venue as deep racer in a man who has deep racer simulator the agent is over for car the environment is over for racetrack the actions are throttling steering him close to the car and the goal is completing the race track as quickly as possible with alan came from the track the car needs to learn the desire driving behavior to reach the goal of complain that track for the carmel learned there's a unrealistic research games years rewards twins analyzer model to learn the desire driving behavior you reinforce the learning the thing driving the learning is called asians in this case is that a give us the preserve our the environment is the place for the age of words which in this example wouldn't be marked racetrack when the agent does something in the environment that provoke sore spots such as crossing a boundary should across that hall an action that response this call a world war a war penalty depending on whether the agent did something to be reinforced or discourage i'm all as the asian lose within the environment it's action should start receiving more wars and fewer penalties until it meets the desire business outcome self driving vehicles bring together among many machine in india going on her was animals to solve the problem we're driving from point a to point b. two of its name tests are the continuous detection of the environment and forecasting changes the symbol detecting objects and localized in predicting the movement of the detective objects the output of these findings actors in which to all other systems that make decisions on what they should do with the vehicles various controls that are used cases in self driving vehicles there are real time responses to the environment for example if a previously hidden pedestrian walks alkaline obstacle the vehicle breaks need to be applied immediately began nino lazy your room for error with these actions not every problem should be solved machine learning sometimes regular programming or welfare needs if you're interested in exploring a potential machine learning solution look at the existence of large day is accidental large number of variables machine learning is often the best choice if you're on certain of the business logic or procedures need to obtain any answer or ca push attacks machine learning systems can be a complex the supporting infrastructure management support and had no expertise need to be in place to help ensure the project's success here that he'd take away his reception where we explored slowly she learning applications are boring part of everyday life first machine learning problems can be grouped into three categories supervise learning is where you have training dana were you or you know the answer all unsupervised learning is where you have a we're looking for insights with emitted reinforced the learning is where the model learns based on experience and feedback most business proms are supervised learning problems what's it for this section will see him in the next video", "CUR-TF-200-ACMNLP-1/video/Mod02_Sect03.mp4": "i am a comeback mrs section three there were already gave you a quick high-level overview of machine learning terminology and a typical work while we will cover these topics in more detail later in this course but for now all will focus on larger picture seventy again you should always start with the business calm you're team will leave can benefit from machine learning from there you want to do some problem formulation in this phase one task is to articulate your business problem been converted into a panel problem after you formulated the problem you move on to the day of preparation and pre processing things you paul dado from waller more data sources the same as yours is my haven't differences in pain or types of me to be reconciled see conforming single cohesive view of your day huh you individualize you did a new statistics to determine the day is consistent been getting used for machine learning will look at some of it is sources later in the corps this example didn't has four columns containing data from the redefine his sources the source is a slightly different way is representing day out and the results are shown on the table in an l. problems columns represent features in our role is represent instances there are some issues here with the day in some of the instances in some cases the only this subject matter expert or a functional expert on thursday in the authenticity of the day at for example the date is represented as all levin to nineteen sixty nine could be november second or february eleventh in the year nineteen sixty nine saloon owners or managers the day of polk would be able to clarify this ambiguity also the word or e-mail can probably be attributed to an import issue or sell shifted position that there could be an outside chance words the actual location molly the city is the capital of the republican maltese at times this air identification isn't as simple annually and as i need to review dana you learn about the role of experts later and scores remember that one of the largest in fact she can have on the success of the machine learning project is to have a consistent and correct day after day is in good shape it's kind of train your model this is where the process is very irritable and you're likely to do many multiple passes a feature engineering training of value weighing and turning before you find a model the major business goals feature engineering is the process of selecting for creating the features your model the train when features of the columns of daily having your guests at the goal of a model is to correctly estimated hardin value for the new day in a heap m. l. algorithm we use the features to predict the target in his example that hornaday that is the average number of steps taken away selecting the correct features cannonball adding we're moving or calculating new features you might want to make a day of formats consists inconsistent formats camille later used in a model or you can make these changes for cosmetic reasons depending on the problem you want to solve this didn't you might not even need to include the name featured an example the one of the country feature if this were a traditional did it you might want to move country to a local cable than references most of them el al reynolds will the data for instance in a single role and el rhythms need numerical dinner process you could consider turning the country text in other countries i so code however the model might interpret the numerical value is having meaning to the u. k. is i so good adios forty four would be more significant than the isotoner out of the u. s. which is zero one in this case splitting and they into local columns is fine this is known as categorical encoding you are about this later in the course for all their types of dana you could convert attacks value into a numerical value for example you could use zero or want to represent male or female these numerical you scum use more easily by the model or not the remaining features like age birthmark which is shown is deep down in a table or gay week which is shown as de odell when you extracting the age worthless and day we might be appropriate depending on the problem you're trying this all those age impact the charter variable one hour which day of the week a moral don't worry this sounds complicated you learn more about featuring a year later the schoolers after your days cleaning you've identified it features you one years it's time to train a model you will use all the data trainer model in fact the bill hold some of it is so you have some good to test where typically you use about eighty percent of the data to train with annual say in the rest of the day of testing next you train along with training dana to diagram the modeling uses the action she boost algorithm the model itself has some parameters you can set these grammar school alter how the algorithm works and they're known as hyper parameters the output of the training job will be a train law with the train model you can use some of the tested to see how well the law performs you take any instance the law hasn't seen a new set of performa production because you or you know that whore in your chest pain and you can compare the two values from these comparisons you can count tele metrics which he did on how well the model was performing you learn it changes to the mall stena features are high for prayers until you find along only yields of best results when training your model there's a real danger of overfishing or honor fitting the model your model is over fitting your training day and when you see them all performs well i'm in training day out what doesn't perform well on the evaluation and this is because the mahler's memorizing and it's all in can't generalize to find seen examples your mama was a blunder fitting the training dana when the model performs corleone in training to this is because the law can capture the relationship between you put examples which often called acts and it's hard and values which are often called why understanding model fit is important for orders in the root cause of death for malek years in this understanding why you take corrective steps you can determine whether a particular model was on earth anymore overfishing the train dana i'm looking at a prediction err on the training day out an evaluation in we're showing the steps he can take ovoid this later the scores after you've retrain them on when you're satisfied with the results you deploy your model to deliver the best possible productions we're an escort for walk you through these different phases and get your hands on experience with each of them but knowing the process is also useful when using the minister is will also explore later we're certainly it was on oil services will do the bulk of the work for you care so that he'd take away to this action first we looked at how all the machine learning pipeline process can guide you through the process of training and evaluating a model the iterative process can be broken if ray broad stabs data processing model training and mala valuation that's it for this video will see you next one", "CUR-TF-200-ACMNLP-1/video/Mod02_Sect04.mp4":

section six will show you how to deploy model so you can make a prediction sections salmon will examine the process of valuing the performance of machine learning model and finally in section eight will work in turning the model the machine learning pipeline isn't iterative process when you work on our real world problem you might find yourself in your reading of many times before your riders solution than major businesses needs in this for section will examine how rough think about turning a business requirement into a machine learning pronto the first step in this phase is to simply define the problem you want us all and inglewood you want to reach an understanding the business goalie is key because your use it to measure the performance earlier solution it's not unusual to solidify that is a problem before you can begin targeting us lucian there are a lot of bother question jacob astor development good understanding of the problem with more information about the problem you can begin framing an approach first to the prom you nice on my machine learning or when a traditional approach made more sense is this a supervisor or on supervise machine lying problem do you have labeled dated to train to supervise all there are many question you could ask yourself man of business ultimately you should try no delegating use a machine learning any should make sure you have access to the right people and dana you should also try to come up with the simplest solution to a problem here's an example you want to identify fraudulent credit card transactions see you can stop the transaction before processes that your problem now was that this is goal or al calm driving has promised a in this case city intended outcome is a word doctrine in the number of customers who and other membership to the credit card as result of fraudulent transaction from a business perspective how do you define success given this problem in the desired outcome this is the stage for you need to move from qualitative statements to quantitative status they can be easily measured gives you an example in measured you can use to define success the economy might be a ten percent reduction in a number of costumers who file claims are fraudulent transactions within a six month period so now you define the business side of your problem it's time to start thinking about this in terms of your machine learning model itself was the actual out what you wanna see through all you want to resuscitate here each of you stay with the reflection and no model could actually outlet an example might be the model will help what whether or not a credit card transactions fraudulent or not fraudulent now that she know would you want your ammo model actually achieved you can use this information to determine it's kind of an hour you're working with if you have historical data were coaster erstwhile reporter fraud transactions you can use this day if you wish you learning perkins this historical day of falls on her knees supervise warning approach will labels are already defined recall from earlier in this course that supervised and all types are counting arrested two grooms classification and regression in the credit card example the desired output of categorizing a transaction years fraud or not fraud to you can see you're dealing with a primary classification problem the route this module you'll see several dataset being used you can access the state assets and many more from the u. c. irvine machine learning repository the first dataset contains numerical information about the composition of wine along with the quality of the one the question you know whilst on this day is set is based on the composition of the wind code we predict that quality and therefore the prize edition a question also uses is said to the statistics deal with it all liars and scale numerical dana the second day is that is a car evaluation database this davis said is heavily taxed face this enables you to exporting going categorical dana which confirms the tax values into numbers to process by machine martin luther dataset is a bio medical data set which also uses the labs the question to answer for this day has said is based on the bio mechanical features can you predict if a patient has abnormality this is al will take you through the entire ends and process bill and with a trainer monolith in tune and you can use to make a prediction in this section we look to help business problems need to be converted into an m. l. problem we also looked at some of the key question to ask which are what is the final success can you measure the alcohol more impact if your solution is implemented knows this is almost on one of two categories the first category is classification which

problems need a lot of dana these are also call observations and you already need to know that hoarded answer or production flooded out this kind of data were you or you know that our interpretation is call labeled dana each observation you dana is made up of two elements that targets and the features that hard it is the answer you want to predict so in a credit card transaction example that hard at any given observation is either fraud or not fraud a feature is it attribute of the example you can use to identify patterns for predicting the charter dancer a feature on a credit card example could be the day of the transaction the vander way mountain dollars of the transaction you might wonder if the source of the target is fraud or not fraud to clean this information is discovered only after the transaction is complete any actual car owner notices a fraudulent transaction understatement this information would be recorded with the transaction for exactly the purpose of using it to train a future model citizen which you know about the elements of an amount is set will return one of the ritual question's one day that you need to actually train your model to breach the desired

determining the features and hornaday your mama will need to make accurate predictions you're gay or should you representative of the deal house we're using them all to make a prediction for example if you want to predict credit card fraud you need a collective for positive or fraudulent transactions you also need a collective for negative or non fraudulent transactions in bold type sunday and so the machine learning algorithm can find patterns old distinguish between the two types suppose your average amount of fraudulent transactions is actually three percent or your training dataset only

like the main standard deviation variance and minimum and maximum values if you need to look at relationships between more than one variable you can consider waldheim various statistics they mostly relate to the correlations relationships between your attributes were cases we have multiple variables are features you might wanna look at the correlations between them it's important to identify correlations between attributes because a high correlation between two attributes can sometimes lead to the floor model performance when features are closely correlated and are all using the same model to predict response variable that could be problems for example them all oscillate not converse to a minimum stay so you wear a highly correlated features a new day has meaning media and are two

perfectly correlated with each other it's like saying why is proportional to acts when the correlation of those two variables is minus one it's like saying why is proportional to minus acts and you in your relationship in which we can be qualified by the correlation so the correlation is zero this means there's been no linear relationship but it doesn't mean that there's no relationship is just an indication that there's no rule in your relationship between those two variables however looking in a number isn't always straightforward austen is easier to view the numbers when the represented by collars now look at the heat at the highest number won in dark green n. minus one is in dark brown the collar gives you both positive and negative directions and it also shows how strong the

at some of the more common tasks in this section most machine learning algorithms work best when numerical dana you wanting to make sure that all columns in your dataset contain numeric data by converting or encoding it you might need to make several passes today she before you can in code for example you might have a variability in the text values such as rose to contain both medium and lapd is values if a categorical day has ordered two one one chilling cold the text into numerical values that captures bore no relationship same and data showing maintenance costs you my raincoat low

example suppose you assign the value of wand to the first caller such as red and you then assigned to to the next value say blew them on local interpret blue is being more important than red ink as blue as a higher numeric mal you ain't going non reward molded into multiple calls her features is a better way think of the new features like to check a box is an example there are three features

two separate variables you might also encountered in a sense that are missing enough for some variables and some day recess will include al wires will cover techniques for dealing with these situations in this section you might find that there is missing for example song calms him you davis said could be missing day and because of the data collection error or maybe dale wasn't collected on a particular feature until the day collection process was underway missing day i can make it difficult to accurately interpreter relationship between the related feature in that hardy variable so regardless of how the day end up being messed it's important for you to deal with this issue on for julie most machine learning our rooms can handle missing values automatically don't need to use human intelligence to octane missing values which gave him its meaningful and relevant to the problem most python lifers ferdinand manipulation include functions for finding missing dana so how do you decide if you should drop warning cute missing values this question is answered in part by better understanding how those values campaign missing in the first place and how much did the missing values were presented with a new larger dataset francis say the missing values are randomly spread around here dataset and don't rubber so larger portion of its respective rower call in this case implication is most likely a better option in contrast say the challenge call her role as a large percentage of missing values in this case dropping entire roll or call would be preferred over invitation if you decide to drop rows of missing didn't you can use guilty and functions to do this for example hand is dropping a function can drop all rosewood missing dana or you can shop specific dana values by using a subset as an alternative to dropping missing values you can imbued values for those missing values there are different ways to impugn the missing value for categorical values the missing

model is donors are faster and cheaper than rapper methods because they don't involve training and models repeatedly rappers typically find the best subset features but there's a risk of overfishing compared to using some sense of features for filter methods in bed and methods are algorithms specific and they might use a combination of both filters and rappers filter rapids is a proxy measure instead of the actual models performance there faster computer that they can still capture how useful the future said it's there are some common measures the first used your son's correlation coefficient which measures the statistical relationship or association between two continuous variables the second is linear indiscriminate analysis or l. d. a. this is used to find a linear

business measured as much as possible there's often a high correlation between the two metrics in a dish in considering your business problem and success flattered that kind of an old problem you're working with full includes the long lecture teachers brother rest of this model will look at examples of common metrics using classification problems will also look econometric shoes in regression

or not cats after mall's been trained eighteen years it has to say he held back to perform predictions to help examined the performs along all you can compare the predicted values with the actual latvians if you haunt the values into a table like the example you can start getting some insights into how well all performed in a confusion matrix you can get a high-level comparison of how liberating classes matched up against the actual classes if he actually more classes cat which is identified as p. for positive and predicted label or classes also can't then you have a true positive this is a good outcome for your mom all similarly if you haven't actually blown up not act which is identified as amber negative and predicted label or class is also not can they do have a true negative is also a good outcome faire model in both these cases your model predicted that correct alcohol when used in testing it there are two other possible outcomes and both are considered good outcomes the first one is when the actual classes negative so you got not cat but the predicted class is positive for cats this is called a false positive because the prediction is positive putting correct finally they're false negatives these testimony natural classes positive same got cat but the predicted class is negative for not cat that's it for par wanna section will see you again for

the confusion matrix of how to different models performed on the same day he tell which ones better which is better isn't a good question as to what you mean i'd better this is entering making sure you find all the cats in if it means you'll get many false positives or is entering making sure the model was the most accurate it's difficult to see just by looking in the church ours but if you're trying several models using multiple folds nfl hundred sunday a point to compare to do that you'll need to calculate more metrics the first magic is sensitivity this is sometimes referred to as we call hit ray or true positive for it sensitivity is a percentage of positive identifications in the cat example you represent what percentage of cats were correctly identified to kindly sensitivity take a number of true causes with a number of positive identifications of cats and in law and that by the total number of actual cats in this example sixteen percent of cats the war camps were correctly identified as tenants specificity is sometimes referred to as selective in a courtroom negative great specificity is the percentage of natives correctly identified in the cat example as the number of images that were not cats the work correctly identified as not caps to cackling specificity taken number of true editors and don't mind that that whole long run a patch wanted it is so for example that's the number on not caps that were correct magnified divided by the total number of actual not cats this means that any example sixty four percent i'm not cats were identified as not cats now that you have these measures for each model know when we're business goal is makes it easier to decide which mall to use which model when you choose if you want to make sure you identified as many cats as possible while b. you would be a good answer if you're not concerned are having many false positives and it's if you're not concerned about having incorrectly identified not cats which will which issues if you wanna make sure you identify animals that were not cats while they might work for this scenario again it would depend on how many false negatives you can tolerate if this was a classification of patients who have heart disease or not which followed the best mrs martin sinner resting upon website mighty a bad reputation they can identify cats correctly but if you're trying to diagnose patients your focus o'connell would be very different it's important to understand the trail shoemaker when you decide which maltese they're also all other matters that can help you make your

to convert the value to a class you need to determine the threshold to use you might think it's fifty percent we could change if you will work for hire to improve your results as you say was sent to jail specificity there's a tradeoff between correctly and incorrectly identified classes changing the threshold can impact outcome or when you take a look at how you can visualize this a receiver operating characteristic graff is also known as an oral lucy graf it's summarizes all the confusion major see is that each threshold for years to build want you type delayed and taught the sensitivity or true positive arrayed against a false positive rate on a graph for each threshold value you can cut away the false positive rate by subtracting the specificity for one after you call those points you can draw line between them the dornin black line from zero zero two one one me is that the sensitivity or true positive rate is the goal to a false positive rate the point at juan juan misa you correctly identified all the cats would you also incorrectly identified all i'm not cats this is that any point on this line news of the proportion of correctly class five samples is the same as the proportion of incorrectly classified samples that pointed zero zero workers as there are zero true pauses and zero false positives on la homeland high sensitivity and roll false positive rate is

which is also known as a day you see or lucy became you see part is the area on under the plot line when a u. c. is higher it means along all be better or tradition cast as cats and i cast as mike capps you can use that a u. c. to quickly compare miles of each other with the four numbers for more confusion matrix you can't hide believe the models accuracy this is also known as it's for you can do this by adding up the car wreck productions and in de mining and number by the total number of productions though accuracy is widely used magic for classification problems it has limitations is a tricky isn't as effective when there are a lot of true native cases today is that they get on a cat not an example if most of your actors is based on true natives it says the u. mom was good at predicting what isn't a cat in this case you might not feel confident new models ability to predict cats after you're on a new production this leads to an example of why it's important to make sure that the magic you choose for mala valuation all lines your business school think about the credit card fraud example in this case using the accuracy germaine metric probably isn't a good idea because you have a lot of true negatives your high true native number might hide the fact your mom also believes identify cases of fraud is to identify true causes isn't ideal as a credit card company is probably an acceptable to have less than almost perfect performance identifying fraud cases that would drive customers away which of the opposite of what you want to achieve a business standpoint this is why to all other matters often used in these situations the first one is precision which essentially removes the negative productions precision is the proportion of positive productions are actually correct you can calculate it by taking the true positive and dividing it by true positive plus false positive one the cost of false positives is high in your particular business situation precision might be a good metric and us occasionally identifies the mail messages to stay on or not in this case you want your mom to label immuno messages stay on bannister nine year users are seeing that message was actually jim or consider an example of all molly means you predict whether a patient has a terminal illness in this case is using precision is your evaluation metric doesn't account for false negatives in your model here for the model to be successful it's crucial in tell us falsely predict the absence of illness in a patient who actually has an enormous sensitivity would be a better measure to use the situation but it doesn't always need to be one of the other e. f. one score combines precision and sensitivity to gather it gives you one number that qualifies the olver all performance of particular an honorable issue consider using it f one score we have a class imbalance want to preserve the equality between precision and sensitivity what you do if you're dealing with the regression problem in that case there are other common metric she can use to annihilate amal including the main square in their remains where there is frequently used the general purpose is the same as when you saw what classification of drugs you determine the production from a model and you compare the difference between a production in the actual outcome more specifically you take the

forecasting as and c. news cases for it forecasting is important area machine learning it's important because there're so many opportunities for predicting future outcomes based on historical data many of these opportunities embalming time component however waldheim component and additional information it also makes time serious problems more difficult to handle compared all their types of predictions you can think of time series data's falling into two broad categories the first time is you know very india which means there's just one variable this second one is a longtime area dana which means there's more than one variable there are several common patterns in time series game at the first pattern is a true friend with h. friend you get a pattern with the values increasing and decreasing or staying the same over time there are seasonal patterns these reflect times of the year long they are on the patterns cyclical patterns are similar seasonal patterns reserve patterns that repeat the the large retail sale of that happens the same time each year finally there are changes in jail or too high and appear to be random for them no discernible pattern there are many uses for forecasting you can use forecasting in marketing applications such as for sales forecasting or demand projections it could also be used in the inventory management systems they anticipate required inventory levels forecasting energy consumption can help predict when and where energy is needed and weather forecasting systems can be used for governments in commercial applications such as

machine learning model has a positive impact because along all kinda rhyme meaning from changes in the data points over time and time series day that tends to be correlated this means that there's a dependency between gay appoints this is mixed results for forecasting is because you're dealing with the regression problem and regression assumes the day appointed independent you need to develop own method for dealing with hidden pennants see you can increase the validity of the productions in addition to the time series didn't you can really ended on a forecasting model for example suppose you wanna make a prediction on retail sales you corning good information of the product being sold such as i'm identification or sales price on with the number of units sold her time period the third time today isn't that a day and out of this at for instance say that shell or retail dataset you might want to include madame de like a brand name of horror genre for music videos shaking group results it's better to have more data when you work with multiple day is sources you face the challenge of handling the time stamp on the day in you observe a difference in the time stamp for men and all their challenges such as in completing a however you like the old tune for missing been some cases for example saying you have a song to come games both belong in a day but no we're observe whether the day is seems to sequence through the montgomery's monday and it's working after twelve if you don't sell you call it an eight year if you knew when the data started you can then in for future years a solo or her own india much higher standard is storing huge pc format but not all day as you should check of the time stamps in local or universal time sometimes the time stamp doesn't represent a tiny think it does for example suppose him and database of cars that were stars our garage is the time stamp indicate it heinrich or ryan was completed burr picked up or does it indicate when the final entry was entered into the system say here china will that hourly caloric intake of patients however you only have a daily didn't then you'll need to him just hit hard times he'll also you dana might not have any time stamps there could be all the ways to extrapolate it times years depending on the day and intimate for example you might have wavelength measurements were factors with an image as a final note remember the daylight savings is differ on world also because of daylight savings time when it occurred twice a year earlier times odds are common occurrence in real world forecasting problems is missing values of our aunt ada missing values makes it harder for a model to general forecast the primary example in retail is it out of stocks situation in demand for casting given item was our stock the sales for the day will zero if the forecast is generated based on those zero sales l. years before castro be incorrect there are many reasons why values to be marked as mrs missing values can occur because i'm noah transaction they can also occur because of possible measurement errors for example a service of modern certain dale was working correctly or is another example the measuring could happen correctly in retail the primaries able friend even though it's a correct measurements is out of stock situation in demand for casting this means that demanded doesn't vehicle sales on de there are several ways you can calculate the missing dana the first that it is for phil this is the last known value for the missing value building on an idea moving an average uses the average of the last known values to calculate the missing value backward fill you sitting next to no value after the missing value in danger here is a year using the future to calculate the past which is then forecasting this method is also known as look ahead in chile avoided in trouble asian uses an equation to calculate the missing value you can also using zero fail this is often used in retail because missing sales there should be calculated the missing dana represents that there were no wars on monday to be wise to investigate why this happened but in this case you don't wanna fill in the missing now it you might get in a different frequencies for example you might have sales stated that includes the exact time stay on the sale was recorded by having inventoried and that only contains the year won't bend day of you and your local when you have a gain of seven different frequencies and other day recess or game is not compatible with your question you might need it down sample down sampling is moving from more finely trained time to alas firing range time as a sample shows this can be covering in our league is set to him daily dataset went down sampling you need to decide how to combine the values in a previous cases sales to solving the quantity makes the most sense if the day is temperature you might want to find an average understanding your dana how to decide what's the best course of action the opposite him down sampling is op sampling when you move from all last i'm lingering time doing more filing rain time the problem with bob sampling is that it's extremely difficult to achieve in most cases support you want to ops employer sales data from daily sales to hourly sales unless you have so bothered is worse reference you would be olivia's there are cases when you need to do something perhaps to match the frequency in other times years or you might have in your regular time series or specific domain knowledge that would help in those cases you need to be careful how you make the conversion for the retail example the best you can do is create a single order for the day as specified in our party temperature you get a copy of the daily temperature into each hourly slot or use a formula to calculate occur in india science al wires have a mix of positive and negative attributes the same is true of times here is the suppose you were examining sales to and you have in order that hasn't been unusually high number of items you might know what to include that in your forecast calculations because the order size nine never be

have different meanings they still out on the worse the surround this is known as contacts often the same words or phrases to no more warnings for example consider the term whether you could be one of the weather which is a colt well meaning in english the hearsay or you could say there's wonderful weather outside which means the weather conditions outsider good the phrase or really could have a surprise this agreement and many other things it has only context an inflection here are some of the main challengers for l. p. one challenge is discovering the structure of the tax one of the first tasks of any piano p. application is gymboree down attacks into meaningful units such as words phrases and census another challenge is away i'm going to after the system covers the techs today and you must apply away impulse representing the various parts of speech every language for choir it different labeling stain to match the languages grammar and opie also faces a challenge in representing

text in the example the words in this and it is far removed to leave the phrase simple taxed after removing stop words you can normalize taxed by covering similar words into a common form for example the war is ron ron or ran and running are all different forms of the war ron you can normalized all instances of these words in a block and tax using the stemming unlimited seychelles processes limitation groups different forms of word into a single term when a decision of the versions of the war ron wood group all instances of those forms into a single term ron standing on the other hand rose characters that the stemming algorithm considers unnecessary standing right now work with the ron example as the former ran my mother recognized as a form of the war or wrong i'm asking him to normalize the text you can standardized by removing wars that are in the dictionary you're using for analysis for example you can ruin acronyms slang in special characters the natural language war kit is also known as an l. t. k. bear python library provides functions removing stop wars and normalizing taxed another for stepping creating an l. p.'s system is to convert the text into one day a collection such as a dear friend all eno que leverage for my conscience to assist of this process example shoes using the word token ice function from the n. l. t. k. library after you've cleaned up

checking her based on tax matching the algorithm for at a distance also known as the leather shine distance is frequently used you can derive relationships between different words or phrases in the tax using a process called cole reference resolution several l. p. systems for by python wipers for deriving relationships one of the biggest challenges for an l. p. is how to describe the context for the tax cuts in this example where users searching for the term tablet because the word talbot has at least two distinct meanings the search engine needs to know which meaning user has in mind most
