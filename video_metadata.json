you can go to learn more about machine learning after completing this module you should be able to identify course prerequisites objectives indicate the role of the day the scientist in business and identify resources for further learning we're now going to look at the prerequisites for taking this course before you take this course we recommend the u. first complete a cameo as academy clown foundations you should also have some general technical knowledge of mighty including foundational computer literacy skills like basic computer concepts e-mail file management and a good understanding of the internet we also recommend that you have the intermediate skills of python programming and in general knowledge of applied statistics finally general business knowledge is important for the scores this includes the insight into how information technologies years in business it's also important business related skill sets such as communication skills leadership skills and orientation torch customer service in this course you'll be interviews to the key concepts of machine learning it holes in it uses you'll also be introduced to him work with someone a nebula services for machine learning you learn how to recognize how machine learning indeed learning are part of artificial intelligence describe artificial intelligence and machine learning terminology identify helmet she'll learning can be used to small business for all this grinding machine learning process was the two holes available today as scientists and identify when to use machine learning instead of traditional software development athens as part of this course you'll also learn how to implement a machine learning pipeline this includes how to formulate a problem from a business request obtaining secured an for shane learning building job or no book by using amazon sage maker ally in the process for evaluating didn't explain why did it needs to be pre process any usable open source tools to examine him pre processed in you also uses the amazon sage later to train a host of machine learning model years across our nation to test the performance of the shimmering model use a host of model for inference korean air was on stage maker ivor perimeter chewing job to optimize along all the factions and finally how are you using managed amazon machine line services to saul specific mission you learning problems in forecasting computer vision and natural language processing will now review the course ally to achieve the course objectives you complete the following models to start in module to you'll get an introduction to machine learning in module three you'll learn how to be implemented on machine learning pipeline with amazon's a drinker models for five and six describe how to apply managed amazon the shimmering services for promising forecasting computer vision and natural language process and finally model seven is a summary of the course it also includes an overview of steps you can take to work for zepeda us certified machine learning specialty the next five slides provide more detail about the some topics covered in each model the purpose of module to is to introduce you to major concepts to understand english in learning section won describes the overall field of vision learning and how machine learning relates to artificial intelligence and the warning in section to you lord nelson of the most common business problems you can solve of machine learning section three distrusted general work full for stalling shimmering problems will also learn some of the more common machine learning terms in session for your views on the commonly used holes one machine learning professionals and lastly in section five younger an overview of some of the common challenges you face we're working with machine learning problems in module three you'll get an introduction to the amazon sage maker and hanging news is you've already machine learning pipeline the module focuses on the application machine learning to salt ramos was several public domain dataset says examples of a shimmering pipeline section one introduces you to defining business problems and it is a tool used during this module section truth or they describe the phases of the machine learning pipeline by using computer vision as an example application in session to you were an collecting secured a section three describes different techniques for a value in india in section four you'll learn about the process of feature engineering section five described the steps shilts hate to train a model with sage later in section six you'll get an overview of the options and sage later for hosting in using along all finally section seven and a cover how much will evaluate and telling your model with state liquor in this module you'll be introduced to use a machine learning to crave forecasts based on a time series a inception want to be introduced to forecasting in some of that common applications section to outlined some of the pitfalls of using time series there to make forecasts finally in section three you'll get an abortion you how to use amazon forecast in this model you were an amusing machine learning for computer vision section one describes the general problems you consult with computer vision in section to you were among the process for analyzing images and videos and in section three and you'll learn the steps you'll need to take to prepare day recess for computer vision in istanbul you'll be introduced in natural language processing of machine learning in section want you were about the general set of problems even saw with natural language processing section to review some of them manage the amazon machine learning services you can use to address natural

roles for machine learning professionals if you're interested in a day is going to stroll focus on developing analytical statistical and programming skills as it is scientists your use those skills to collect analyze and interpret large this is some universities now offer degrees and a assignments again as scientists often have degrees related fields like statistics that computer science or economics as a scientist you're a technical competencies in statistics machine learning programming languages in de analytics if you like to have a careerism issue you're an engineer the skills you only you'll be similar to revere scientists skill set when they are scientists were shimmering in years boss or our technical competence season statistics and machine learning however your focus more on programming skills and softer architecture that analysis interpretation as an issue mining engineer you apply those programming in architecture skills to design an old machine learning systems were shimmering engineers often have previous experience was offered a bellman and they rely more heavily on programming and software engineering and father were shame learning rolls you might also be interested in a career in science we can apply machine learning technology cheer field the shimmering is having any impact in everything from astronomy to zoology so there are many different paths open to as applied science research or your primary focus will be on the type of sideshow working on killing some of the same skills as it is time to we'll also need to know how to apply those skills you chosen domain thus applied science rolls alter our technical competence in statistics spanish in learning many soft developers are now hearing great english you learning to their applications if you're interested in a courier software developer you should also include regime loring technology new stars as a machine learning developer your primary focus will be so offered on skills will also need some of the same skills as a scientist to make sure you take course working statistics and applied mathematics and years of my own over this model we recommend reviewing your student died in your study guide you find links to documentation of all the resources you used to alpha course that's it for this international thanks for watching will see you next video"

o. first will discuss where she learning fits in a larger picture wish you learning is a subset of artificial intelligence or am i this is a broad branch of computer science this focus on building machines they can do human tasks people earning is a song domain of machine learning to understand where it is all fit together we'll discuss each one as we just mentioned me she learning is a subset of a broader computer science field known as artificial intelligence ai focuses on building machines they can perform tasks are human would take a quick perform in contemporary popular culture you've probably seen a allies in movies television or works of fiction for example you might have seen a isaac control world around them when they start acting on their own initiative these ai started this computer agents the perceive their environments and take actions to it she was assuming all remaining on the outcome the greatest really wish for other fictional ai skinner extent sullivan humans as helpers are workers they generally do a better job working with humanity other more general in purpose these kinds of a eyes are examples of artificial general intelligence or a g. i they have the capacity to lower understand any tax the healing can ai problems typically stand many fields of research such as natural language processing reasoning knowledge representations learning perception and physical in bahrain interaction ai isn't yet the reality for us bayliss were all truly living is simulation but every year we moved closer to ending each of those areas you have also rather seeing commentary and ethics of creating ai not all the years of positive perhaps farley in fear of the militias fictional as the one to destroy humanity or using his power sources or perhaps they're concerned about the risk of mass unemployment because an intelligently sheen could work twenty four salmon and not need any breaks the oriental we're not going until the next robot ai in this course maybe an extra if you do a search you can only find many definitions of machine learning there isn't a universally agreed upon definition sol star by looking at kabul definitions for example we could say machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms in statistical models to perform a task by using the inference instead of instructions this is a bad starting point a key point year is using algorithms as statistical models instead of instructions to help you better understand this will apply this idea to a concrete example suppose you need to write an application that determines if an email message to stammer not without ratio morning you need to write a complex series of decisions the shoes in gift and l. statements you also need to use words in the subject or body the number only example length of a message to determine if an email message is salem really hard am labor intensive to build all our summer rolls covering every possibility that machine learning however you can use a list of e-mail messages or marcus am or not stay i'm a train a machine learning all the model with them alarm which patterns of words way it and other attributes are good indicators of spam messages if you present along with an email message it hadn't seen before the model would perform a production to say whether the message was stale or not stale people earning represents a significant reborn the capabilities for artificial intelligence of the shimmering that the reminded warning was created from hell the human brain works an artificial neural network or cannon is inspired by the biological neurons found in the brain all of the implications become very different artificial neurons have one or more imports and a single out what these neurons fire or activate their house was based on the transformation of the influx a neural network is composed of layers of these artificial neurons with connections between the letters they're typically input output he and his lawyers in our the output of a single neural and connection the influx of all when you're on stay in the next layer the network is an ass to solve a problem the input layers populated from the training dana and then you're on saturday to outer layers until it answers presented in the alpo later the accuracy of the output is then measured in the alpine doesn't mean you're threshold the training is repeated

your e-mails sailor filter is the result of a machine learning program that was trained with examples of stale and regular you know masters based on what you reading our product you want me she'll learning programs can predict all their books or prodigy likely be interested in again the machine learning program was trying with data from other readers have its emperors when detecting credit card fraud the she'll infrared were strain on examples of transactions that turn out to the fraud along with normal transactions you probably think and many more examples from social media applications eugene facial attention to grumpier photos detecting brain tumors in brain scans or finding anomalies in extremes there are three main types of machine learning their supervise learning or a modeling is is known in puts an all points to generalize future out what's theirs on unsupervised learning with a model doesn't know him put her out what's so it finds patterns in the day without help and there's reinforce the learning with a model interacts with its environment and learned to take actions that wall maximize rewards it's important to know the different types of m. l. because that height will guide you course selecting algorithms that makes sense for solving your business draw what's one more in each of these types supervise learning is a popular type of an owl because it's widely applicable it's called supervise learning because there needs to be a supervisor a teacher or cooking show the right answers as the white any state in the supervised algorithm needs to learn by example essentially it needs a teacher who uses training dana to help and determine the patterns relationships between u. puts out what's if you want to build an application to detect credit card fraud you'd need training to that includes examples of fraud and examples of normal transactions with a unsupervised learning there are different types of problems classification and regression third to some types of classification problems the first is a binary classification think back to the example with identifying fraudulent transactions that are never able and is example is limited to two options fraudulent or not fraudulent this is a binary class vacation problem they're also like class classification problems these dental problems classify observation into one of three or more categories same g. m. and m. l. model the predicts why customers calling your store chain to reduce the number of transfers needed before costly gets to the crack customer support a partner in this case is different koster support apartments were present over ryan you potential party variables which giving many different apartments much more than just to there also were aggression problems in our russian problem you're no longer masking indian put two and a fine number of categories instead you're mapping in england tweaking teen u. s. value what the nurtured one example of an m. l. regression problem is predicting the price of a company stock computer vision is a good example of civilized learning is is i can or a dog is there a tumor in this x-ray computer vision is often bill with people earning models it on it's the extraction analysis classification and understanding of useful information from a single image or sequence images computer vision it enables machines twenty five people places and things in images with accuracy at or about human levels and with greater speed and efficiency the image ticking taken many forms such is the single images video sequences views from multiple cameras or three dimensional day and you'll learn more about computer vision lira's course will not discuss was supervised the she'll learn sometimes all you have is the day and there's no supervisor in the room in all unsupervised learning labels are provided like they are was supervised learning you know in all the variables and patterns in these instances the machine has to uncovering create the labels itself these models used to date other presented with to detect emerging properties of the entire day recess then they can shrug hundred from those properties clustering is a common some category of one survives learning this time algorithm groups the into different clusters basis similar features it does is to better understand the attributes of a specific cluster for example by delisting customer purchasing habits was revised algorithms can identify groups of customers that are associated with the size tier of accompany the advantage of one supervised on rooms is that enable you to see patterns and in the war aware of before natural language processing is also known as an l. p. this is another area of machine learning is experiencing role if you've ever use all access or any and all the voices system they'll use an old peter trying is your question and l. p. isn't just about speech is also about written tax an elk he shows up in many applications for example an hour he's used with chat or call center box which are automated systems that helped you get your bank accounts will order food for russia you can use an opium translation tools which covered tax between languages for example you might use applications the translating menus real time i know he is also used in voice to tax translations which covered spoken words into tax and finally an l. p. good news then sends an analysis which you can use to analyze the sentiment of commons and reviews of products music and movies the senate's could be used to give the movie audience reading you were more about penalty later in the scores another kind of machine learning this thing gaining popularity recently is reinforced the learning on like a father ratio learning reinforce the learning continuously improve is a small by mining feedback from previous generations in reinforce the learning an aging continuously learns to trial and error as interaction in barman we enforce learning is broadly useful when the reward of undesirable and is known that the path to achieving it isn't an act have requires a lot on trial and error to discover take the example of a venue as deep racer in a man who has deep racer simulator the agent is over for car the environment is over for racetrack the actions are throttling steering him close to the car and the goal is completing the race track as quickly as possible with alan came from the track the car needs to learn the desire driving behavior to reach the goal of complain that track for the carmel learned there's a unrealistic research games years rewards twins analyzer model to learn the desire driving behavior you reinforce the learning the thing driving the learning is called asians in this case is that a give us the preserve our the environment is the place for the age of words which in this example wouldn't be marked racetrack when the agent does something in the environment that provoke sore spots such as crossing a boundary should across that hall an action that response this call a world war a war penalty depending on whether the agent did something to be reinforced or discourage i'm all as the asian lose within the environment it's action should start receiving more wars and fewer penalties until it meets the desire business outcome self driving vehicles bring together among many machine in india going on her was animals to solve the problem we're driving from point a to point b. two of its name tests are the continuous detection of the environment and forecasting changes the symbol detecting objects and localized in predicting the movement of the detective objects the output of these findings actors in which to all other systems that make decisions on what they should do with the vehicles various controls that are used cases in self driving vehicles there are real time responses to the environment for example if a previously hidden pedestrian walks alkaline obstacle the vehicle breaks need to be applied immediately began nino lazy your room for error with these actions not every problem should be solved machine learning sometimes regular programming or welfare needs if you're interested in exploring a potential machine learning solution look at the existence of large day is accidental large number of variables machine learning is often the best choice if you're on certain of the business logic or procedures need to obtain any answer or ca push attacks machine learning systems can be a complex the supporting infrastructure management support and had no expertise need to be in place to help ensure the project's success here that he'd take away his reception where we explored slowly she learning applications are boring part of everyday life first machine learning problems can be grouped into three categories supervise learning is where you have training dana were you or you know the answer all unsupervised learning is where you have a we're looking for insights with emitted reinforced the learning is where the model learns based on experience and feedback most business proms are supervised learning problems what's it for this section will see him in

that is the average number of steps taken away selecting the correct features cannonball adding we're moving or calculating new features you might want to make a day of formats consists inconsistent formats camille later used in a model or you can make these changes for cosmetic reasons depending on the problem you want to solve this didn't you might not even need to include the name featured an example the one of the country feature if this were a traditional did it you might want to move country to a local cable than references most of them el al reynolds will the data for instance in a single role and el rhythms need numerical dinner process you could consider turning the country text in other countries i so code however the model might interpret the numerical value is having meaning to the u. k. is i so good adios forty four would be more significant than the isotoner out of the u. s. which is zero one in this case splitting and they into local columns is fine this is known as categorical encoding you are about this later in the course for all their types of dana you could convert attacks value into a numerical value for example you could use zero or want to represent male or female these numerical you scum use more easily by the model or not the remaining features like age birthmark which is shown is deep down in a table or gay week which is shown as de odell when you extracting the age worthless and day we might be appropriate depending on the problem you're trying this all those age impact the charter variable one hour which day of the week a moral don't worry this sounds complicated you learn more about featuring a year later the schoolers after your days cleaning you've identified it features you one years it's time to train a model you will use all the data trainer model in fact the bill hold some of it is so you have some good to test where typically you use about eighty percent of the data to train with annual say in the rest of the day of testing next you train along with training dana to diagram the modeling uses the action she boost algorithm the model itself has some parameters you can set these grammar school alter how the algorithm works and they're known as hyper parameters the output of the training job will be a train law with the train model you can use some of the tested to see how well the law performs you take any instance the law hasn't seen a new set of performa production because you or you know that whore in your chest pain and you can compare the two values from these comparisons you can count tele metrics which he did on how well the model was performing you learn it changes to the mall stena features are high for prayers until you find along only yields of best results when training your model there's a real danger of overfishing or honor fitting the model your model is over fitting your training day and when you see them all performs well i'm in training day out what doesn't perform well on the evaluation and this is because the mahler's memorizing and it's all in can't generalize to find seen examples your mama was a blunder fitting the training dana when the model performs corleone in training to this is because the law can capture the relationship between you put examples which often called acts and it's hard and values which are often called why understanding model fit is important for orders in the root cause of death for malek years in this understanding why you take corrective steps you can determine whether a particular model was on earth anymore overfishing the train dana i'm looking at a prediction err on the training day out an evaluation in we're showing the steps he can take ovoid this later the scores after you've retrain them on when you're satisfied with the results you deploy your model to deliver the best possible productions we're an escort for walk you through these different phases and get your hands on experience with each of them but knowing the process is also useful when using the minister is will also explore later we're certainly it was on oil services will do the bulk of the work for you care so that he'd take away to this action first we looked at how all the machine learning pipeline process can guide you through the process of training and evaluating a model the iterative process can be broken if ray broad stabs data processing model training and mala valuation that's it for this video will see you next one"

documents they contain live cody equations visualization is an area tax uses included the ake remaining transformation numerical simulations statistical modeling is yours is machine learning and much more jupiter lab is a when based interactive development arming for jupiter notebooks coding and day out to the lab is flexible you can use it to configure our range the user interface to support a wide range of work closing day of science scientific computing in machine learning to carolina's extends all and modular you're right plug ins and you coupons in a ring of existing ones we're in this course you're using cameras on stage maker which hosts both jupiter notebooks and jupiter lab candace is open source high fall library is used for d. a. handling an analysis pandas represents day amid table similar to us reggie this table is known as a panacea for a nap long live it is a python library for creating scientific static animated and interactive visualization some python ewing is a degenerate clots of you dale later in the scores seaborne is another day of visualization library for python it's built on a map long live the it provides a high level interface for drawing attractive an informant a statistical grabs no high as one of the fundamental scientific computing packages and python it contains functions for an dimensional ray objects it also has useful malfunctions such as linear algebra for your transformed and random number capabilities side to learn is an open sores machine learning by brutus supports supervised and on supervise learning it also provides various schools for model fitting it reprocessing model selection evaluation and many other utilities side to learn is built on numb high side high and now plot live it's a good tool for exploring the she'll earn only only use it to borrow a few functions miss course you might wanna consider exploring after you completed scores moving out from an individual iverson packages they're also told that contained production ready framework is we already mentioned side killer which is a good library for machine learning the framework support and aid of us such as cancer flow and careless also include libraries you can use for machine learning all the framers listed here were supported on eight of us think you'd be used for me amazon sage later in the u. s. also provides computing senses are tuned for machine learning in both the clown n. at the edge computer instances in the optimize for learning an inference another eight annas resource you can use force or an amazon machine images realize we offer pre packaged a allies to contain many of the popular framework is finally there's amazon sage maker which is a damn u. s. service with many capabilities first stage later can deploy machine learning uses is running jupiter no books and your lab it manages the deployment east impure resources see only need a connectivity ivar varma sage baker also provides schools for labeling dana training models and hosting trainer miles in this marketplace also provides a selection of ready to use small packages and algorithm sugar hoarding regime learning developers in u. s. also provides a sudden manage machine line services and you can integrate them in your applications even if you don't have substantial machine learning experience for computer vision it was already nation provides object in facial recognition for both image and video also amazon tax tract can extract tax fraud images stage services include amazon polly which can speak taxed another speech service is the amazon transcribe which covers spoken audio to tax or language amazon comprehend uses an l. p. to find the insides of relationships and tax also amazon translate can translate texting in different languages if you want to work with chapel that's amazon lacks hopes to build an interactive conversational applications the use of waste or tax for forecasting amazon forecast uses machine learning to combine time series day with additional variable see you can build forecast and finally if you like to work with recommendations it was on her soul is can help you create individual personalize recommendations for customers these minister says or even trained in many aspects of the promenade you only need to provide your specific didn't get started or we'll look in many of these men services and the second half of the scores after you learn how to do things on your own became take away is for this section include these points first python is the most popular language for performing machine learning tasks jupiter notebooks provide you with a web based hosted development armor for shame learning to use jill brooke looks frito lay machine learning daria large number of open-source cole such as tennis that you'll use often as a machine learning practitioner finally depending upon your requirements you might start with low-level framework hickory wrong solution you might also

does problem before we get started here is reminder of the machine learning pipeline will again in a previous model and help them maps to the sections in this model this section section want will confirm how formulate a problem it will also karla davis s. will use about this model section two will discuss how to obtain in securing dado for your shame learning activities in section three we'll show you tools and techniques for gaining an understanding of the day that then in section four will look a pre processing unit and so is ready to train a model section five will cover so lacking in training inappropriate machine learning model section six will show you how to deploy model so you can make a prediction sections salmon will examine the process of valuing the performance of machine learning model and finally in section eight will work in turning the model the machine learning pipeline isn't iterative process when you work on our real world problem you might find yourself in your reading of many times before your riders solution than major businesses needs in this for section will examine how rough think about turning a business requirement into a machine learning pronto the first step in this phase is to simply define the problem you want us all and inglewood you want to reach an understanding the business goalie is key because your use it to measure the performance earlier solution it's not unusual to solidify that is a problem before you can begin targeting us lucian there are a lot of bother question jacob astor development good understanding of the problem with more information about the problem you can begin framing an approach first to the prom you nice on my machine learning or when a traditional approach made more sense is this a supervisor or on supervise machine lying problem do you have labeled dated to train to supervise all there are many question you could ask yourself man of business ultimately you should try no delegating use a machine learning any should make sure you have access to the right people and dana you should also try to come up with the simplest solution to a problem here's an example you want to identify fraudulent credit card transactions see you can stop the transaction before processes that your problem now was that this is goal or al calm driving has promised a in this case city intended outcome is a word doctrine in the number of customers who and other membership to the credit card as result of fraudulent transaction from a business perspective how do you define success given this problem in the desired outcome this is the stage for you need to move from qualitative statements to quantitative status they can be easily measured gives you an example in measured you can use to define success the economy might be a ten percent reduction in a number of costumers who file claims are fraudulent transactions within a six month period so now you define the business side of your problem it's time to start thinking about this in terms of your machine learning model itself was the actual out what you wanna see through all you want to resuscitate here each of you stay with the reflection and no model could actually outlet an example might be the model will help what whether or not a credit card transactions fraudulent or not fraudulent now that she know would you want your ammo model actually achieved you can use this information to determine it's kind of an hour you're working with if you have historical data were coaster erstwhile reporter fraud transactions you can use this day if you wish you learning perkins this historical day of falls on her knees supervise warning approach will labels are already defined recall from earlier in this course that supervised and all types are counting arrested two grooms classification and regression in the credit card example the desired output of categorizing a transaction years fraud or not fraud to you can see you're dealing with a primary classification problem the route this module you'll see several dataset being used you can access the state assets and many more from the u. c. irvine machine learning repository the first dataset contains numerical information about the composition of wine along with the quality of the one the question you know whilst on this day is set is based on the composition of the wind code we predict that quality and therefore the prize edition a question also uses is said to the statistics deal with it all liars and scale numerical dana the second day is that is a car evaluation database this davis said is heavily taxed face this enables you to exporting going categorical dana which confirms the tax values into numbers to process by machine martin luther dataset is a bio medical data set which also uses the labs the question to answer for this day has said is based on the bio mechanical features can you predict if a patient has abnormality this is al will take you through the entire ends and process bill and with a trainer monolith in tune and you can use to make a prediction in this section we look to help business problems need to be converted into an m. l. problem we also looked at some of the key question to ask which are what is the final success can you measure the alcohol more impact if your solution is implemented knows this is almost on one of two categories the first category is classification which can buy near a warm old high class as yourself does that korean belong to a class and the second canneries russian presidents that yourself can you predict a

need to actually trying your model she knitted desired output and subsequently achieve your intended business outcome you have access to them is so how much did you have and where is it one solution can use to bring all the state into one centralize repository be as to his question is are essential at this stage the good news for boeing davis scientists isn't are many places read contained in a private dinner from you or your existing cost are already exists including everything from walk miles to cost around voice data bases private they can be useful depending on the problem you're trying to solve in many cases friday is found in many different systems will look at harboring resources together shortly sometimes you want to use did that was collected and made available by commercial organization companies such as reuters change health care donna bradley and foursquare maintained amy's you can to try to gain could carry the news stories anonymous health care transactions global business records am location did you view supplement your own dinner with commercial dana you can get a useful inside you when i'm gonna otherwise there are also many open-source status as ranging from wanting quality to movie reviews these innocents are made available for use in research or for teaching purposes in the u. s. cattle in the u. c. i. machine learning or posit or is a good places to find open-source davis that's governments and health organizations are all other sources of day and it could be useful supervised machine learning problems need a lot of dana these are also call observations and you already need to know that hoarded answer or production flooded out this kind of data were you or you know that our interpretation is call labeled dana each observation you dana is made up of two elements that targets and the features that hard it is the answer you want to predict so in a credit card transaction example that hard at any given observation is either fraud or not fraud a feature is it attribute of the example you can use to identify patterns for predicting the charter dancer a feature on a credit card example could be the day of the transaction the vander way mountain dollars of the transaction you might wonder if the source of the target is fraud or not fraud to clean this information is discovered only after the transaction is complete any actual car owner notices a fraudulent transaction understatement this information would be recorded with the transaction for exactly the purpose of using it to train a future model citizen which you know about the elements of an amount is set will return one of the ritual question's one day that you need to actually train your model to breach the desired output and subsequently unintended business outcome is an example of a stage need an oil pipeline when it's crucial to domain expertise help you as question widow may knowledge you can start determining the features and hornaday your mama will need to make accurate predictions you're gay or should you representative of the deal house we're using them all to make a prediction for example if you want to predict credit card fraud you need a collective for positive or fraudulent transactions you also need a collective for negative or non fraudulent transactions in bold type sunday and so the machine learning algorithm can find patterns old distinguish between the two types suppose your average amount of fraudulent transactions is actually three percent or your training dataset only includes a very small fraction of fraudulent summations say zero point four percent in this case it'll be difficult for your mom all to truly learned pattern your awaited a fraudulent transactions them might encounter in production there are many different servers in aid of us were you could find our story aired in a terrorism he's services you my years amazon simple storage services also known as a osama s. three it provides object local storage with that story you can soar as much again as you want in the form of objects which even in those files it could be seen as the files or files of all the format jeannie as sleeping the access to the web

is gloria nestle in your planning to run training job several times a day for now rhythms of parameters you could use the amazon after sex for lobster it's a final system servers that speeds up your

available to sage baker you can use the same amazon after sex file system for subsequent iteration some training jobs which prevents repeated down loads of common as three objects alternatively your training him might already be in the amazon elastic file system or amazon yes that's it so we recommend using the empress is just a distortion training didn't if you want your training jobs too were actually from the service without needing him movement which results in faster training start times this is often the case in fireman's where'd years scientists have whole directors in the amazon yeah that's making quickly air raid on our models by bringing in new dana sharing deal with colleagues experimenting with different fields or labels in their day recess for example indian scientists can you say jupiter noble to do an initial cleansing on a training center and wanted training job for me amazon days later they can then use their jupiter notebook to draw called and relaunch the training job and finally come harold resulting models to see which one works better there are many other aid of us services resources we might find in for example you could use the amazon relational database circus or amazon r. d. s and manage glacial database as you can also use amazon red shift which is a managed in a warehouse circus another option is the amazon times your name on marriage time series database designed specifically to handle large amounts of data from the inner nothing's or coyote the inman's the outer on instances on amazon alas to compute cloud which is also known as the amazon

understand it descriptive statistics hope to gain valuable insights into you didn't say you cannot effectively pre process today an emperor paratrooper animal will look at how you can do that in discuss why it's so important first descriptive statistics can be organized into a few different categories or all statistics including number of roseanne number of columns in your dataset this information which relates to the dimensions of your day is very important for example aching indicate you're too many features which can lead to higher dimension alley and hormonal performance after the statistics are another type of destructive statistic specifically for numeric attributes there used to get a better sense of the shape of your attributes this includes properties like the main standard deviation variance and minimum and maximum values if you need to look at relationships between more than one variable you can consider waldheim various statistics they mostly relate to the correlations relationships between your attributes were cases we have multiple variables are features you might wanna look at the correlations between them it's important to identify correlations between attributes because a high correlation between two attributes can sometimes lead to the floor model performance when features are closely correlated and are all using the same model to predict response variable that could be problems for example them all oscillate not converse to a minimum stay so you wear a highly correlated features a new day has meaning media and are two different measures describing extending your day is clustered around some value or position mean can be useful method for understanding you didn't win the day is symmetrical however if you didn't use tudor contains our wires then we intend to provide the barometric for understanding your data as it relates to central tennessee for instance if you have at our wires with large values and mean kenny's you one way when services director representational where values are truly center media is affected by our wires in the same way or talk more about ally ursus statistics are available and they can be viewed on numerical that by using methods such as described there are also alder methods to calculating mean me in and others big also the statistics on single or multiple calls it the anger of data by specific values for categorical attributes you can look at the frequency of that trim our using it is that that information will give you some idea about what is inside that categorical variable the diagram here shows the car dataset which is layout of several categorical values buying names longer won't safety dance class safety can neither low medium or high from being described function you can see that there are three unique and values with low being the most frequent looking at a class called it appears that hop tell you of the four is the u. n. ac c. which stands for unaccounted this accounts for one thousand two hundred and ten although one thousand seven hundred twenty eight values or seventy percent this lansing destiny in dallas fort harkin variable and also the categorical type you can look at the class distribution to see whether there's a class in mountaineer dataset in our state can mark a disproportionate ratio for your classes for instance you care center is made up of credit card transactions but only a tenth of a percent is level was fraud in this case is your algorithm mind mahler well enough to predict examples of credit card fraud visualization could help you gain the insight into you didn't you might not be aware of other was testing ground is often a good visualization technique for seeing the overall behavior of a particular feature with a history of you can answer questions like is the featured in norway distributed how many kids are there in the day that is there any stealing us for that particular picture when using his degree amsterdam visualization values are pinned to taller peaks of the history and indicate the most common values for numerical features you can use density plots and blot clots edition in stirrups to get an idea of what's inside that particular feature like a history out these visualization to help you answer questions like what's the range of india the peak of idiot are there any al wires are there any special features a answering these questions come to understand today a better and it also help you decide if you need a new more specialized in a pre processing it ought to slot is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical they are through their court files when you have more than two numerical variables in the future davis that you might wanna look in their relationship a staffer plot is a good way to identify any special relationships among those variables in this case is bill left diagram has sulfate is an alcohol there to numerical variables suppose you want to show the relationship between these variables you can use as chatter plot to help you visualize that they're potsdam her round and a correlation along them might not be that high because it is scattered however you might find some relatively positive relationships between the two variables scanner paniccia c. is how you look at the relationship between multiple different features in it and as you can easily create scanner pon major seized based on my callers you want to look at this example has three columns in the war give the pair why is scanner plot for any two calls with the scanner plot you might want to identify special regions that particular sobs and take it into any example is there are relationship between alcohol sulphate spin calling you get caught those values against good and for quality wines like the example plying gives you an idea how news full particular variables can be if you're using them for classification problem that's it for part two of this

wires are points in india said that why an abnormal distance from other values they're not always something you want to clean up because they can witness today assess that they can also make it harder to make accurate predictions because they steal values away from the other more normal values related to that feature an ally or might also indicated in dana point actually belongs to another call you can think about our wires is falling into too broad categories the first is a single variation for just a single variable or a unitarian outlier the second is a variation of two or more variables or a malt i'm harriet i'll hire one of the more common ways to find unitary our wires is with a box law in a box plot shows how far and employee is to the mean for them variable the boxy look like shows the day of values within two or tiles of the main body is outside the range are represented by the winds extending from a box which are sometimes called whiskers the stature plot to effective way to seem all siberia liners for example this diagram shows the amount of soul phase out all in a collector winds with the scanner plot you can quickly visualize where there are more timeshare in our wires for the two variables the origin of your al where will most likely inform how're you deal with it during this pre processing phase of the pipeline or possibly later during featuring hearing there are several different approaches to dealing with our wires you going to leave the outlier if you're our wire is based on an artificial error this means the howler isn't natural it was here news because of some failure like incorrectly intraday that you can also transforming outlier by taking the natural on the value this and her reduces the variation caused by the extreme ally or value which would then burned u. c. l. liars influence on the overall this finally you can use the meaning of the future and impute that value to replace the l. wire value again this julian good approach of the allaire was caused by artificial air this is an exhaustive list but describes the most common options after you've extracted features you'll need to select the most appropriate features for training your mom all there are three main feature selection methods to older methods you statistical methods to measure the relevance of features either correlation with the target variable rapper methods measure how useful a subset of features they do this by training a model on the future and in measuring how successful model is donors are faster and cheaper than rapper methods because they don't involve training and models repeatedly rappers typically find the best subset features but there's a risk of overfishing compared to using some sense of features for filter methods in bed and methods are algorithms specific and they might use a combination of both filters and rappers filter rapids is a proxy measure instead of the actual models performance there faster computer that they can still capture how useful the future said it's there are some common measures the first used your son's correlation coefficient which measures the statistical relationship or association between two continuous variables the second is linear indiscriminate analysis or l. d. a. this is used to find a linear combination of features that separates two or more classes the third is an analysis of variants or i'm noah this is used to analyze the differences among group means unassailable and finally kinds where is the single number that tell you how much difference exists between your observed counts an account should expect if there were absolutely no relationships of the population filters are usually less computational intense and then rappers but they produce a feature said it is and tuned to a specific type of freedom on all this lack of tuning means a feature several filter is more general than one from our wrapper the filter also usually has a lower production performance honor rapper however the filters features that doesn't contain the assumptions of protection law so it's more useful for exposing relationships between features many filters provide feature ranking instead of an explicit best feature subset and a cock point in the rating is chosen to cross validation filters and also being used as a pre processing step for wrappers which enables or wrapper to be used on larger problems rapper methods using predictive model to score feature some sets each new subsidies used to train a model which is an intestinal holdouts at this school or for that subset is calculated by counting the number of mistakes made on a whole moussa or that error rate on a model because rappers train in new model for each subset there computational intensity however they usually provide the best performing features that that particular type and model or crawl forward selection starts with no features n. n.'s them into all the best model astound backward selection starts with all features drop some wanted time and then select the best model imbedded methods combine the call is a filter am rapper methods there are implemented by algorithms have their own built-in features selection methods some of the most popular examples of these methods are lasso and reassured russian in build in hell was asian functions to reduce overfishing nurse and he'd take away his reception

global wanting to victoria class and only between zero and won to convert the value to a class you need to determine the threshold to use you might think it's fifty percent we could change if you will work for hire to improve your results as you say was sent to jail specificity there's a tradeoff between correctly and incorrectly identified classes changing the threshold can impact outcome or when you take a look at how you can visualize this a receiver operating characteristic graff is also known as an oral lucy graf it's summarizes all the confusion major see is that each threshold for years to build want you type delayed and taught the sensitivity or true positive arrayed against a false positive rate on a graph for each threshold value you can cut away the false positive rate by subtracting the specificity for one after you call those points you can draw line between them the dornin black line from zero zero two one one me is that the sensitivity or true positive rate is the goal to a false positive rate the point at juan juan misa you correctly identified all the cats would you also incorrectly identified all i'm not cats this is that any point on this line news of the proportion of correctly class five samples is the same as the proportion of incorrectly classified samples that pointed zero zero workers as there are zero true pauses and zero false positives on la homeland high sensitivity and roll false positive rate is usually the goal so it's considered to be in better when the line between the threshold recordings is closer towards the top left corner if you have the data from two models you could climb out the larose curve for each fall in japan however that any tea is this another rat continues this will look at next another evaluation metric you can use is the area under current receiver operator per which is also known as a day you see or lucy became you see part is the area on under the plot line when a u. c. is higher it means along all be better or tradition cast as cats and i cast as mike capps you can use that a u. c. to quickly compare miles of each other with the four numbers for more confusion matrix you can't hide believe the models accuracy this is also known as it's for you can do this by adding up the car wreck productions and in de mining and number by the total number of productions though accuracy is widely used magic for classification problems it has limitations is a tricky isn't as effective when there are a lot of true native cases today is that they get on a cat not an example if most of your actors is based on true natives it says the u. mom was good at predicting what isn't a cat in this case you might not feel confident new models ability to predict cats after you're on a new production this leads to an example of why it's important to make sure that the magic you choose for mala valuation all lines your business school think about the credit card fraud example in this case using the accuracy germaine metric probably isn't a good idea because you have a lot of true negatives your high true native number might hide the fact your mom also believes identify cases of fraud is to identify true causes isn't ideal as a credit card company is probably an acceptable to have less than almost perfect performance identifying fraud cases that would drive customers away which of the opposite of what you want to achieve a business standpoint this is why to all other matters often used in these situations the first one is precision which essentially removes the negative productions precision is the proportion of positive productions are actually correct you can calculate it by taking the true positive and dividing it by true positive plus false positive one the cost of false positives is high in your particular business situation precision might be a good metric and us occasionally identifies the mail messages to stay on or not in this case you want your mom to label immuno messages stay on bannister nine year users are seeing that message was actually jim or consider an example of all molly means you predict whether a patient has a terminal illness in this case is using precision is your evaluation metric doesn't account for false negatives in your model here for the model to be successful it's crucial in tell us falsely predict the absence of illness in a patient who actually has an enormous sensitivity would be a better measure to use the situation but it doesn't always need to be one of the other e. f. one score combines precision and sensitivity to gather it gives you one number that qualifies the olver all performance of particular an honorable issue consider using it f one score we have a class imbalance want to preserve the equality between precision and sensitivity what you do if you're dealing with the regression problem in that case there are other common metric she can use to annihilate amal including the main square in their remains where there is frequently used the general purpose is the same as when you saw what classification of drugs you determine the production from a model and you compare the difference between a production in the actual outcome more specifically you take the difference between the production and actual value school where that difference and in some odd ball was clear differences for all the observations in sky killer you can use a mean squared error function to whack whiff of image live or there are all their magic shaking useful in your mom all stitches or squared so you train jamal perform adventure is from asia minor test a net and calculator metrics now when you do you'll use these measures tell you to know them all you call in selecting a different set of features a trainer mali gan after year retrain them all as yourself which was about a model the measures will help inform you you caught also use different in a new retrain a model with same features remember capel cross foundation for earlier in this model finally you going to the parameters of the monolith south which is the subject of the next section here are key take away is from this section of a model to evaluate a model you need to have ended up a model hasn't seen this could be either a whole outset or you can use k. fold cross validation different regime learning models use different metrics classification can use the confusion matrix and a new c. or obscene you can generate prominent regression kenya's main square that's it for section seven c. n. n.'s video"

recall from an earlier module that hyper parameters can be gone on as the nom zipped along the machine learning algorithm to improve its performance nelda were looking more explicitly returning models it's time to look more specifically and in different types of hyper parameters and how to perform hyper parameter optimization our couple of different categories of hyper parameters the first kind our model hyper perimeters they held the final model itself as an example can zero in neural network for a computer vision problem with this case additional attributes of the architecture needed to find white filter size pooling and astride were patting the second kind are optimize or hyper parameters they relate to help along all learned patterns based on bail and they're used for neural network model these types of hyper printers include optimize years like a great any dissent and stochastic gradient is a they can also include optimize years they use momentum like adam or that initial lies the premier waves with methods like xavier neutralization or he initials asian the third kind or data hyper parameters they relate to the attributes of the day itself these include attributes that define different tale augmentation techniques wake cropping or re sizing for image related problems there are often use when you don't have enough data or not variation in your dana turning hyper parameters can be very labor intensive traditionally this was done mainly by someone when domain experience related to the hyper perimeter in the u. states this person would name you we select fiber parameters based on their intuition been experience than they would train a model and storage on validation data this process will be repeated over and over again until a cheap satisfactory results this manual process isn't always the most thorough an official weight chewing ivor parameters with sage baker you can perform automated hyper perimeter turning with the amazon sage later on madame altering it claims the best version of a model by running bloom old coltrane johnson you dataset by using the algorithm and hyper brammer ranges you specify invention is a hyper bremmer values the results in a molokai forms the best as measured by magic you choose to use is down zero process regression to britain which hyper primmer values might be most affected improving fit it also uses days in optimization developed exploring the hyper printers faced an exploring specific hyper primmer values when appropriate and importantly on american model tuning can be used with built in algorithm to sage later freed will keep climbing frame works and we're in your own algorithm containers supposing you want us all of binary classification problem boss fraud is your goal is to maximize the area honor that a u. c. curve magic of al run by training all in your lower algorithm model you don't know which values of the warring ray dale won dated two and the politicians used to train a small to find the best values for these hector parameters you can specify ranges of values it's a major hyper perimeter turning once or you won't find a common asian values the results of the training job the performs the best as measured by the objective metric the u. chose a sample sage maker hyper perimeter turning watches training jobs they use hyper bremmer values in the rain is you specified and then returned to the train job with the highest a new c. i. for perimeter turning might not necessarily improve your mom all it's a advanced call for building machine solutions as such it should be considered part of the scientific method process when you build a complex machine learning systems played people earning neural networks exploring all possible combinations impractical to improve optimization use the following guidelines in ukraine hyper perimeters first instead of using all hyper parameters limited number of hyper primers to the one shooting would give you good results the range of values for lack of preparation choose to search came significantly affect the success of hyper premier optimization although you might want to start smile large range the covers every possible value for ever perimeter you get better results by limiting your search to a small range of our needs if you get the best measured values without parlor range consider limiting the range of all laid out our enduring hyper perimeter tuning sage baker attempts to figure out of your hyper printers are long tailed oral linear scale initially it assumes the hyper parameters are linear scale invasion the long scaled it might take time for safe return to discover not solve it you know the hyper premier should be along scaled a new kingdom for yourself doing so can improve hyper premier optimization running more hyper perimeter turning jobs concurrently get more work done quickly but to winning job improves only through successive rounds of experiments typically running one training job at a time that she is the best results with the least amount of computer same eleven distributor angel of the wrong some old boy instances in this case hyper perimeter turning uses the last

a man is davis captured in chronological sequence over undefined period of time introducing time into a machine learning model has a positive impact because along all kinda rhyme meaning from changes in the data points over time and time series day that tends to be correlated this means that there's a dependency between gay appoints this is mixed results for forecasting is because you're dealing with the regression problem and regression assumes the day appointed independent you need to develop own method for dealing with hidden pennants see you can increase the validity of the productions in addition to the time series didn't you can really ended on a forecasting model for example suppose you wanna make a prediction on retail sales you corning good information of the product being sold such as i'm identification or sales price on with the number of units sold her time period the third time today isn't that a day and out of this at for instance say that shell or retail dataset you might want to include madame de like a brand name of horror genre for music videos shaking group results it's better to have more data when you work with multiple day is sources you face the challenge of handling the time stamp on the day in you observe a difference in the time stamp for men and all their challenges such as in completing a however you like the old tune for missing been some cases for example saying you have a song to come games both belong in a day but no we're observe whether the day is seems to sequence through the montgomery's monday and it's working after twelve if you don't sell you call it an eight year if you knew when the data started you can then in for future years a solo or her own india much higher standard is storing huge pc format but not all day as you should check of the time stamps in local or universal time sometimes the time stamp doesn't represent a tiny think it does for example suppose him and database of cars that were stars our garage is the time stamp indicate it heinrich or ryan was completed burr picked up or does it indicate when the final entry was entered into the system say here china will that hourly caloric intake of patients however you only have a daily didn't then you'll need to him just hit hard times he'll also you dana might not have any time stamps there could be all the ways to extrapolate it times years depending on the day and intimate for example you might have wavelength measurements were factors with an image as a final note remember the daylight savings is differ on world also because of daylight savings time when it occurred twice a year earlier times odds are common occurrence in real world forecasting problems is missing values of our aunt ada missing values makes it harder for a model to general forecast the primary example in retail is it out of stocks situation in demand for casting given item was our stock the sales for the day will zero if the forecast is generated based on those zero sales l. years before castro be incorrect there are many reasons why values to be marked as mrs missing values can occur because i'm noah transaction they can also occur because of possible measurement errors for example a service of modern certain dale was working correctly or is another example the measuring could happen correctly in retail the primaries able friend even though it's a correct measurements is out of stock situation in demand for casting this means that demanded doesn't vehicle sales on de there are several ways you can calculate the missing dana the first that it is for phil this is the last known value for the missing value building on an idea moving an average uses the average of the last known values to calculate the missing value backward fill you sitting next to no value after the missing value in danger here is a year using the future to calculate the past which is then forecasting this method is also known as look ahead in chile avoided in trouble asian uses an equation to calculate the missing value you can also using zero fail this is often used in retail because missing sales there should be calculated the missing dana represents that there were no wars on monday to be wise to investigate why this happened but in this case you don't wanna fill in the missing now it you might get in a different frequencies for example you might have sales stated that includes the exact time stay on the sale was recorded by having inventoried and that only contains the year won't bend day of you and your local when you have a gain of seven different frequencies and other day recess or game is not compatible with your question you might need it down sample down sampling is moving from more finely trained time to alas firing range time as a sample shows this can be covering in our league is set to him daily dataset went down sampling you need to decide how to combine the values in a previous cases sales to solving the quantity makes the most sense if the day is temperature you might want to find an average understanding your dana how to decide what's the best course of action the opposite him down sampling is op sampling when you move from all last i'm lingering time doing more filing rain time the problem with bob sampling is that it's extremely difficult to achieve in most cases support you want to ops employer sales data from daily sales to hourly sales unless you have so bothered is worse reference you would be olivia's there are cases when you need to do something perhaps to match the frequency in other times years or you might have in your regular time series or specific domain knowledge that would help in those cases you need to be careful how you make the conversion for the retail example the best you can do is create a single order for the day as specified in our party temperature you get a copy of the daily temperature into each hourly slot or use a formula to calculate occur in india science al wires have a mix of positive and negative attributes the same is true of times here is the suppose you were examining sales to and you have in order that hasn't been unusually high number of items you might know what to include that in your forecast calculations because the order size nine never be repeated we're moving these al wires anomalies is known as smoothing smoothing your data can help you deal with al wires and other anomalies there are a few reasons why you might consider serving first during game in preparation you ruined there are values think of all sore move our wires you might also want to

is as a group after you generated a forecast big inquiry of forecast you can also export it to a market in the amazon us three and finally beginning crypt the day and the forecast before exporting it the overall process for working with the amazon forecast is to be important historical related am amazon forecasting specks that dana identifies chideya and selects an appropriate algorithm to use is the algorithm to train in optimize it cost a lot all and producer predictor you crave forecast by applying the predictor treated us as you can then retrieve these forecasts in it a dentist management

you're working in your domains ranging from retail to web traffic and there's also a costume option for everything else by selecting a domain you improve efficiency of the projector each domain has specific types of getting a supply when you build a critic for example the retail domain expects data for the i. m. identifier is a time stamp for the observation the number of sales for that item and

lady because i am added it's typically doesn't change related data for creating a more useful forecast could include the sales price or other promotion in a tilling just actually i don't you must include the time stamp and the iron lady here's an example of the day you need to provide for all when traffic forecast for the time series you need the web page eighty the number of pages used her long arrow that time stamp related for creating a more useful forecast could include the page category such as navigation urquhart a category you'll also needed geographic identifier for the wet

why don't you want our los are a messy calculate how far off the forecast in values were from the actual testing a p. r. i. missy finds the difference between a natural part italian is i am the forecast in value for that time period and then swears the differences the example shows how to calculate are a messy your messy value represents the standard deviation of the parishioners this test is good for forecast validity when errors are mostly of the same size that is there there are many are liars lower or a messy metrics indicated the models forecasts are more reliable here's an example of how when retailer might use the accuracy no tricks to evaluate a forecast the retailer wants to predict the demand for sales of particular brand of shoes they include the sales records his friend in de amazon forecaster korea predictor the predictor provides a forecast in demand a one thousand pairs with the p. ten k fifty n. p. ninety values shall the way that quiet town was values the tape it ten percent of the time to review within a hundred and eighty parish sold fifty percent of the time fewer than one thousand fifty pairs of diesel and ninety percent of the time fewer than one thousand two hundred years will be sold the retailer continues these values determine which level of image were told they can basic decision on their assassin of the west that they will be able to fill orders or that they'll have excess inventory some kid take away isn't this section of the model including you can use it amazon forecast to training years along over time series day and there are specific stamos define for domains searches retail and easy to contest the planning or you can use of customs came you need to supply at least the time series dana but can also provide netted a whirl

automated the extraction information from digital images using computer vision machines can identify people places and things and images with it accuracy this pam warren on human waffles and with greater speed and efficiency computer vision is often bill windy morning models it on a mainstay extraction analysis classification and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images the image they can take many forms such as single images video sequences views from multiple cameras or three dimensional the computing power and algorithms haven't they have stolen last ten years this has led to an increasing capabilities and easier access to computer vision technology is so how was computers in the news here some of the primary use cases for computer vision you can use him angel facial recognition to improve public safety in home security or as a way authenticate accessed first own devices you can also use it to automatically classify images for content mansion analysis autonomous driving is parley enable my computer vision technologies and solarz safety features a car's such as lame detection or collision avoidance medical imaging houses with computer beijing can improve the accuracy in speed of a patient's medical diagnosis this can result in better trained now comes the life expectancy for the patient and finally in manufacturing well trained computer vision is incorporated into robotics this can improve quality assurance an operational officials is just a few examples in you probably think i'm more computer vision problems coming broken down into a few areas content recognition is about identifying keynesian images it's a classification problem with a complex one with several layers in that picture here was represented is breakfast lunch or dinner with the class occasionally the food the answer depends on what model you used to perform a classification walls must be trained in a training day that provides the algorithm when they offered to learn from c. n. n. jamal which train with pictures of different types of food you might expect the image that all the categories such as milk cages mashed potato chicken nuggets and salad if you train them on with different images it could classify objects as trey cutlery and napkin instead when you work with images you might want to know what kinds of objects in the image am the location of those objects object detection provides the image categories and where the object show located in the image is the center of quarters the final occasional boxes around in the image which is known as the bounding box bounding boxes for detection are typically top left with an hi cornet surrounding images you can use these corn is your applications when objects are detected an image there's a confidence number usually associated with that object this percentage indicates the probability that the object belongs to a specific class is common islam was important when you were determined action that space on object detection especially in facial detection applications or cases we need action has significance objects segmentation is also known as semantic segmentation it's like an object attention when you go when i'm more indeed fails to get find out years for each detected object basically it's a fine grained inference for predicting each pixel in the image some applications that require object segmentation include autonomous vehicles and advanced computer human interactions though optic segmentation isn't he a problem in the field of computers and won't be covering underscores the video and in no other dimension the computer vision with video you jim moret gave it to work with c. you can capture the movement of people are objects which referred to lose instances for example you can detect people who and certainly in frames and also you're moving cameron's here's the u. states for computer vision building on detection in tracking you can analyze shopper behavior in your retail store by stoning that pat each person follows hideous face analysis you can understand and other details about shoppers such as average age ranges gender distribution an express emotions without identifying them here's another computer vision use case you can also analyze the images to identify actions using the motion video for example activities such as delivering a package for dancing looking at this image of a baseball player some examples to the image could include capturing the batters accuracy the pictures are teaching style that type of pitch slow ball slider others the inning and the banners performance versus the specific picture measures can use of all that day and a coach players on how to improve their performance and they do coaches can also use it did during the day to make game time decisions say you want to initiate various actions based on the speed of the baseball in the matter is rejecting ahead it's time to live by it and no model could lead to an all yellow or a visual warning about possible foul ball in a crowd war it could result in a preemptive all are ahead as a high probability of being a home run this means that advance following a home run could be both well timed and automated such as playing music or setting off fireworks when the home runs hit by the home team to wrap up this section hearers and he'd take

him some recognition including creating search want image and video levers amazon recognition makes both images and store video search will see you can discover the objects and seems that here and i'm you can use him some recognition to build a face-to-face news or verification system so your applications can confirm user identities by comparing airline image with the reference image amazon recognition interprets emotional expressions such as happy sad or surprise begin also interpret demographic information for facial images such as gender amazon recognition can also detect inappropriate continental images and store videos and finally amazon recognition can recognize extracts tax content from the images before we go further here's a quick known as security you need to check if the applications you build using amazon recognition fall under any regulatory restrictions as defined in your field your country security in compliance for amazon recognition is a share first possibility between any of us at a cost or for more freedom on this topic see the aid of us compliance page amazon recognition is in danger of us managed service within marriage service amazon host the machine learning models maintains an eap i am scales out to meet demand for u. you can benefit from the cell walls that constantly learning prove also you can focus on billy applications to use the a. p. r. i. and i actually training disservice to understand your unique business needs there are various resources you can use access to interact with them some recognition such as a key allies

j. s. and c. plus lots finally there was a recognition in a great football the reagan era services for example if you need storage you can use him as on simple storage service or history for authentic asian authorization you can use a gun us identity and access mansion which is also known as i am this diagram illustrates an image search feature were users can take pictures and get information about the real estate properties are viewing first the user takes a picture with the room all the vice the user them initiate a search which causes the application to buffalo to amazon mastery x-rays configured to call all for services for ryan occurs in this case the bach it passes the esrey path of an object to any of us lambda one away and a function is called a uses the amazon recognition as dk to call the servants amazon recognition analyzes the image the tax aspects of the property creates labels and passes the information back to lay and as an object for matinee in java script object notation or jason leigh and other than stores labels and compliments for in the amazon all last six years service which also known as amazon yes application users can now identified aspects of our property using a objects that were detected in the image in this example architecture this system checks all bloated images for inappropriate contact when the previous example processing begins when the user apocalypse content first the use or publicity image to amazon s. three second the best reebok it is considered a call when a function one object is written to the market there are way on calls amazon recognition cnn s. t. k. amazon recognition that analyzes the images are inappropriate content and says the response back to lambda for a if the content is appropriate because has approved that if the content isn't appropriate the content in the center for man your inspection and finally if the content is approved the notification sent to the user in this final use case the system here lies and video feed for sentiment announces first and being restored camera captures video it's an essential back office or a cloud base application technically an application like this uses amazon kinney says to stream the video second the application uses the best ek to send a video to amazon recognition for further analysis visual sense is extracted along with all other attributes such as age thirty undiscovered engineers were sent to him some cases for a land of function extracts the data from the stream hit it is then return to vastly next big day is loaded in the amazon rain shared our regular basis and finally cole's like amazon quick side can be used to generate reports from india amazon recognition is designed a key ingredient your applications to the baby eyes and as the case a cia operations are provided for detecting labels faces recognizing celebrities and attacking on safe images to perform a prediction provide the service with an image object in the amazon s. three or i'll blow up like stream of an image images union j. and fourteen g. formats amazon recognition process is the image performs the production and returns and jason object with the results when amazon recognition performers traditions it off the returns multiple labels each label has a conscience all this conference will vote indicates how likely the way was found in the image like this example shows whales can also hierarchies when you find a instances of objects you need to understand where undetected object is in the image forty each instance the results from amazon recognition include abounding box that contains the starting cordova top left hand box the mansion somewhere heights white example you can use this information to determine the location of the technology and in the image it's important note that all flinging skinned incompetence or you can use the continent scoring or applications to the tune your response to projections that irish for it's more likely the

specifically for detecting faces and facial features facial protection has many of the same features is standard object detection such as abounding box with a quartet of the box around in the face that was detected this for a good value representing that confidence that the bounding box contains a face though we'll listen attributes is found such as is the faces of the year two or if it appears to be male or female door also be a conference for for these attributes it can also detect physical emotions like one of the persons smiling or frowning it's important to understand this class vacation is baseball young visual clues and so it might not represent the actual a motion of the person they show landmarks are components of the face such as eyes and mouth typical landmarks also include x. and y. coordinates quality describes the brightness and the sharpness of the face and hollows describes the rotation of the face inside the image again conferences a feature here is provided for each detected a feature and remember the theater production is based only on visual observations with the amazon recognition you can compare to images to determine if they contain the same person comparisons require both resource mandatory damage the results will include all the faces that were found and a good information about matching and no one matching faces again conference course indicate how likely each productions amazon recognition can also search for known faces to use this feature you need to train a model by providing a collection of images two years after you train a model you can then detect those people in images you provide to find it known faces first grader collection and and faces to the collection amazon recognition will perform facial recognition on the images you provide you will never return to cool information but abounding box quartets with confidence or to associate faces with an image specifying the image i indeed any baxter old image ninety request perimeter this can be the file aim of the image or another i mean you create after you create your collection you can then use the search faces by the image operation to search for faces from the collection the return again and contains a ray of all phases of matched the information includes battling boxes conference wars any dexter own image idea value you can then use this idea value to link back to the source image now future lord of the facial detection features an amazon recognition here's a summary of the guidelines to discuss so far with the amazon recognition detects a human face it captures abounding box that shows where a phase was found in a video became also detect action news such as the position of the eyes nose and now they can detect emotion the quality of the detection and any landmarks that might hear all these items will have an associate incompetence or a higher swore me is the model has greater confidence about the detection genders inferred from the image not infer from identity similarly emotion is also determined from the image and unlined not reflect the subjects actual emotional state how should i apply facial recognition responsibly facial recognition should never be used in a way that violates an individual's rights including the right to privacy it should also never be used to make autonomous decisions for scenarios are current human being to analyze them for example suppose that a hughes's schools like amazon recognition in a financial application to verify their customers identity is that men should always clearly disclosed the use of the technology and asked the cost of march will prove their terms and conditions for more information on this topic see that eight of us web page about the fact some facial recognition with artificial intelligence will now explain how you can use amazon recognition to process videos you can perform a video processing on both stored videos and video streams store video should be off loaded in store industry market each type of detection has it's own start operation you can search for people faces labels celebrities tax and inappropriate conduct amazon recognition publishes a completion status to a topic in the amazon simple notification service which is also known as amazon as us with an ancestor around these messages to subscribers for durability it's a bass practiced round messages to a message to be an amazon simple care service or amazon asked us your application should monitor the asked us to for completion each star operation has a corresponding get operation for treating the results if you call get detection results which runs on our way of labels they contain information about any labels found in a video though when all information includes the same labels as in a detention but it also includes a time stamp on wearable label was detected in milliseconds from the start of the video in addition to stuart videos you can also use amazon recognition video to detect they recognize faces in streaming video a tangle use cases is detecting a known faces in the video trade amazon recognition video uses amazon kenny says video streams to receive a process of a new strain the analysis results are output from the amazon recognition video two attorneys as tears streamed there then read by your clan application amazon recognition veil provides a stream processor that's called create stream processor and you can use it to start and manage the analysis of the streaming video to use amazon recognition video with your streaming video it application must employ these resources first you need a kinney says video stream to send streaming video to amazon recognition video next you need an amazon recognition video stream processor to manage the streaming video analysis and finally you need a kidney ciskei is string consumer to worry the analysis results that amazon recognition video cents to a string if you want to find a face in a video you need to create a collection this process is the same is creating a collection for still images amazon recognition video places a chase on frame record for th analyze frame into the kidneys is output strain amazon recognition video doesn't analyze every frame is passed to it to kenny says the usher in a frame record ms sedgwick county says data stream contains information about which videos dream fragment of frame is in the wherein a frame is in a fragment and faces the recognized in a frame it also includes status information for the stream processor before wrap up here is a quick summary amazon recognition is a computer visions service that's based on people are in you can easily an image and video now sister applications amazon recognition can detect faces sentiment taxed once a content am library searching both images and video amazon recognition is in a hurry with other in a u. s. arms race for watching will see you next video"

a model year dataset should have at least two labels with at least ten images her label each image in your dataset boss the label as you mentioned earlier you can use the amazon recognition cost own labels console or amazon sage maker ground troops to wait we're images again to train an easy amazon recognition caused the labels on all your images lost the label on label indicates that in the image contains an object seen or concept as we mentioned earlier and dataset needs at least to define the labels also each image must have at least want assign a label that identifies the object seen or concept in the image when you apply labels to an image as a whole these labels are known as image lovell labels they're useful for identifying scenes are concepts the want to tax for example one of the images shows of beach scene from colina it's a long island of oahu in the u. s. state awful why to each frame a model to detect and beaches in an eight page labeled that applies to the entire image you can also apply labels to specific areas in image that contain an object you wanted attacked for example if you want your mom to detect amazon echo devices it must identify the different heights of echoed devices in an image the model needs information about where the devices are located in the image and a new set corresponding label that identifies the type of the device this information is known as globalization information the location of the device is expressed as abounding box example objects with bounding boxes image shows abounding box has some rounds in the amazon echoed on the image also contains an amazon echo with al abounding box the output of the labeling process will be a manifest five the manifest file for an image will label typically contains the label or class came along with some meditate about how the image was labeled or object attention the manifest contains information about the age when old image the bounding box identifies where the object is in the image along with the label of the downing box belongs to we've mentioned amazon sage major ground troops of few times will now look at what is and how might help you with sage baker ground truth you can build high quality training day recess for your shame learning models to use it korea and this is the needs labeling you then provide details ensure auction someone needs to be labeled and submitted job you can decide whom process is the images to korea will dataset you can use workers from the amazon a cannibal church service in fender company or any internal work force with me she learned you can use away it'll get us out of her sage baker ground troops to train your own models or you can also use it with amazon recognition cost only adults say to make her brown truth can use active learning to automate the labeling of your input in an active learning is a machine learning technique that identifies day at the shooting labeled by your workers in stage richard roundtrip this functionality is call automated dale labeling on the gale labeling to reduce the timing cost it takes to label you dataset compared using only human workers when you use automated labeling you incur amazon sage made her training and inference costs yes we just setting you can use machine learning to label the images real mania is ratio learning will talk to how this works when sage maker ground troops started on a daily boring job it's alike so random sample of input data are objects and sends it to human workers with the label day is returned safely her ground troops uses the state which is the validation data to validate own walls that were trained for on a daily italy sage baker ground troops was a batch transform job using the validated model for inference on a validation data that g. inference produces a conference for an equality major for each object in the validation data on in labeling determines of the continent score for each object which was priestess of five nice to require threshold which was determinism for if the congress for me to the threshold expected call him on at labeling exceeds the request of level accuracy the object is then consider to be on at the label steps next produces and dataset of all the label do with confidence course sage baker ground troops alexis de appoints low conference course of the status on and sends them to human workers for additional labeling safely heard round trip then uses the existing human label dana any additional human level they have to train a new model the process is repeated until the dataset is fully labels or until another stopping condition is not for example automatic labeling can stop when you made your budget for human imitation we recommend using automated dale wailing on large day recess the minimum number of objects allowed for automated dale labeling is one thousand two hundred and fifty however we strongly suggest providing a minimum of five thousand objects that's it for part of this

        "transcription": "we'll get started by reviewing when natural language processing means natural language processing it is also known as an l. p. before we explain what elkins will consider an example of an out the amazon what all like some works by having a device such as amazon backup reporter words the recording of yours stage is set to amazon servers to be analyzed more efficiently amazon breaks down your phrase into individual sounds then he can actually database continued pronunciation various words to find which war's most closely correspond to the combination individual sounds amazon identifies him forward to make sense of the tasks and carry out corresponding functions for instance if alexa notices wars like outside or temperature to open the weather alexa skill amazon servers decennial for asian actor device and alexa steaks and l. p. is oberon term for in general center of business or computational problems you saw what machine learning r m l however an l. p. systems screamed a machine learned for example stage attacks on a bowler pretty smart phone cellphones years then okay and so it's green readers many an l. p. systems in our new song for one machine learn and l. p. considers the hierarchical structure of language wars are a little low was wearing a hierarchy of group of words make a phrase international law phrases make a sentence and alternately services convey ideas and o. p. systems face several significant challenges will look a challenge next languages and precise words can have different meanings they still out on the worse the surround this is known as contacts often the same words or phrases to no more warnings for example consider the term whether you could be one of the weather which is a colt well meaning in english the hearsay or you could say there's wonderful weather outside which means the weather conditions outsider good the phrase or really could have a surprise this agreement and many other things it has only context an inflection here are some of the main challengers for l. p. one challenge is discovering the structure of the tax one of the first tasks of any piano p. application is gymboree down attacks into meaningful units such as words phrases and census another challenge is away i'm going to after the system covers the techs today and you must apply away impulse representing the various parts of speech every language for choir it different labeling stain to match the languages grammar and opie also faces a challenge in representing context because word meaning can depend heavily on context and the anno pieces dummies away represented this is a large challenge because there are many contacts it's difficult to come over context into a form computers can understand finally although where we're to find a structure for language the application of grammar is indescribable enlarge and stone handling the variation in howling which is used by humans is a major challenge for n. o. p. systems that for shame learning channel large impact you can apply an opiate full range of problems some more common applications including search applications such as google are being human machine interactions like alexa sends an analysis for marketing or political campaigns social research is on the analysis and chat box to mimic human speech in applications you can apply the machine learned on a pipeline you stink about this course when developing in l. p. solution the first task is to formulate a problem then collect and label data for an l. p. collecting data system breaking down the taxing and meaningful sunsets and wailing assess feature engineering is a major part of an opium occasions this process gets complicated when you're dealing with highly irregular we're on track should tax for example say you're building an application declassified documents you need to be able to distinguish between the word to a common terms but different meanings labeling didn't elkind elaine is sometimes also call to hanging in the labeling process you assign individual tax strange to different parts of speech there specialist was eighteen years for an l. p. winnowing the first task for an o. p. application is chicken or the tax today and so it can be analyze you confirm tax by removing wars that are needed for analysis from the input text in the example the words in this and it is far removed to leave the phrase simple taxed after removing stop words you can normalize taxed by covering similar words into a common form for example the war is ron ron or ran and running are all different forms of the war ron you can normalized all instances of these words in a block and tax using the stemming unlimited seychelles processes limitation groups different forms of word into a single term when a decision of the versions of the war ron wood group all instances of those forms into a single term ron standing on the other hand rose characters that the stemming algorithm considers unnecessary standing right now work with the ron example as the former ran my mother recognized as a form of the war or wrong i'm asking him to normalize the text you can standardized by removing wars that are in the dictionary you're using for analysis for example you can ruin acronyms slang in special characters the natural language war kit is also known as an l. t. k. bear python library provides functions removing stop wars and normalizing taxed another for stepping creating an l. p.'s system is to convert the text into one day a collection such as a dear friend all eno que leverage for my conscience to assist of this process example shoes using the word token ice function from the n. l. t. k. library after you've cleaned up you're taxed and loaded into a dinner for him you can apply one of the n. l. p. models to create features here a couple of common hobbles the first model is known as the bag of words this is a syllable model for capturing the frequency of words in the dark in the model creates a key for each word the value of the key is the number of times a word person document the second model is different frequency and inverse dodging a frequency which is also known as t. f. i. b. m. her own frequency is a count of how many times a word appears in a dark in inverse dodging a frequency is the number of times of workers in a group of documents these two values are used to gather to kauai going away towards wars that frequently appear in any documents hell or wait there are many established also you know p. field example shows a bag of words model back of words is a factor model vector models comfort each sentence or phrase into one factor which is a mathematical object the record both direction ellie and magnitude in the example is simple sentence is converted into a factor when the frequency of each word is recorded the word is as a value too because it appears twice in the sense that her words is often used to classify documents into different categories it's also used to drive it actually means that feed into an old he applications such as in sentimental says there are three in broad categories of tax analysis first the classification text is similar to other classification system to santa scores tax provides the input to a process that attracts features a new set of teachers don't wish you learning algorithms that interaction the class fire model and infers the classification are many applications for tax matching for example or a correct spelling and grammar checking her based on tax matching the algorithm for at a distance also known as the leather shine distance is frequently used you can derive relationships between different words or phrases in the tax using a process called cole reference resolution several l. p. systems for by python wipers for deriving relationships one of the biggest challenges for an l. p. is how to describe the context for the tax cuts in this example where users searching for the term tablet because the word talbot has at least two distinct meanings the search engine needs to know which meaning user has in mind most search engines were lying on the most commonly used context if the term isn't qualified further for example by adding another term like medicine or computing to search the process of extracting kennedy's is known as named any recognition or any of our and any our model has the following functions first aid to identify now phrases using a panacea charts and part of speech hanging became classified phrases using a classification over them such as war two that finally begin descended you wait and he's using in knowledge grab here's an example of using any art to extract the annie's titanic and north atlantic phone attacks after the game devotees are attracted you can use the knowledge graf to attract me and knowledge graft combined subject matter expertise with machine learning to drive me the imbecile recommendations engine is an example of a knowledge for here are the main points remember from ascension first and l. p. predates wishing you learned you can use the same anno were floating you see in all the models rowdy some of them may news cases for an opiate our search for analysis human machine interaction and marketing and social research and l. p. is complicated because human language wax persuasion base for watching will see
